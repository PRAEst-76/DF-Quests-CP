"Ok, so there's this guy... he owns _farm_.
Rumour has it he's got a lot of riches stored up
for his daughters dowry. Problem is no-one will
marry the girl because she looks like a horse."

"We're not greedy, we don't want to deprive the
girl of her dowry. We just want to take one thing.
It's a goblet. A mate of mine tried to propose to
the girl but the dad laughed him out of the place
because he smelled grift on him, but he got a good
eye on the goblet and he knows his stuff. Says it's
worth a small fortune. He didn't think they had any
idea the way they just left it out like that. So I
got a fake one made."

"A %pct like you might fool the old guy into
thinking you are something serious, while you are
in there you can swap the goblets and get out.
Just say you got called to adventure or something
and will come back for the wedding. You never have
to see the mare again."

"Go. And maybe put something nice on. Look
presentable, but not too presentable... just be
yourself. If yourself is presentable. And good
luck."

"Excellent. Looks pretty too. This will help
pay for my family to start a new life."

"What? Where's the goblet?! This was not the deal."

%qdt:
_questgiver_ will give me the map if I help
%g2 steal a goblet from _farm_. To do this I
need to propose to the farmers daughter
and swap the goblet with a fake. Then get out
before they start planning the wedding.
