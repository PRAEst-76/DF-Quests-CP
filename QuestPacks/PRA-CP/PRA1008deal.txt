That _questgiver_ has been hanging around for weeks. Meeting at __questgiver_ with rum types.
<--->
A lot of strangers coming and going to __questgiver_ lately.
<--->
I don't like the look of a lot of these strangers that have been through of late.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_tailor_ is still looking for some poor mug to marry that daughter of his.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear _tailor_ finally got someone to take his daughter off his hands. Poor bastard.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Have we met?

QuestorPostFailure:   [1009]
Have we met?

"Ok, so there's this guy... a tailor. He owns
_tailorhome_ in __tailorhome_. Rumour
has it he's got a lot of loot stored up for his
daughters dowry. Problem is no-one will marry the
girl because she looks like a pack-horse."

Message:  1015
"We're not greedy, we don't want to deprive the
girl of her dowry. We just want to take one thing.
It's a statue. A mate of mine tried to propose to
the girl but the dad laughed him out of the place
because he smelled grift on him, but he got a good
eye on the statue and he knows his stuff. Says it's
worth a small fortune. He didn't think they had any
idea the way they just left it out like that. So I
got a fake one made."

Message:  1016
"A %lev like you might fool the old guy into
thinking you are something serious, while you are
in there you can swap the statues and get out.
Just say you got called to adventure or something
and will come back for the wedding. You never have
to see the mare again."

Message:  1017
"Here's the bogus statue. Go. You've got =weddingsoff_ days to
get to __tailorhome_ and back. And maybe put
something nice on. Look presentable, but not too
presentable... just be yourself. If yourself is
presentable. And good luck."

Message: 1018
"Excellent. Looks pretty too. This will help
pay for my family to start a new life."

Message: 1019
"What? Where's the statue?! This was not the deal."

Message: 1020
"Good %hnr. To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?"

Message: 1021
"My daughter? Well I... _daughter_ is
her name. My only beloved child. This shop will all be
hers when I go, and of course that will be shared with
her spouse. Whoever that may be..."

Message:  1022
"I should let you both get aquanted. Wait here
good %hnr and I will go and fetch her. I er...
believe she is dressing as we speak."

Message:  1023
"Here she is. My beautiful _daughter_. I shall
leave you two alone to get... better aquainted."

Message:  1024
"Good %hnr. I'm afraid I am a somewhat shy girl.
I know not what to say to a %lev like yourself.
I have lived here in __tailorhome_ all my life.
Many have come to attempt to woo me buit none
such as you, boorish bankers and shifty men after
my fathers' deeds."

Message: 1025
"But you. You are an adventurer! What an exciting
life you must lead %hnr! Not like the life of a tailor."

Message: 1026
"I'd love to live a life of excitement and adventue,
it's so boring here living with my dad. He wants me
to be some tawdry goodwife to a toff, but I want to
run away and have adventures."

Message: 1027
"Maybe you could take me away? Do you have a horse?"

Message: 1028
"I've ridden before. Dad thinks I haven't but one
of the stableboys took me in the stables. I've
been riding regularly with the boys in secret.
Don't tell dad!"

Message: 1029
"I'd love to ride with you. Into the wilds. Wildness
excites me. There's no wildness here. It's dull."

Message: 1030
"Have you got anything to say to me? Any formal
question to ask?"

Message: 1031
"I tell you about myself and then you ask your
question and I say yes and then you need to go
on urgent business in another country and then
we get a letter saying you were eaten by a
troll."

Message: 1032
"That happened with Lord Marwyen. Got ate
by a troll in Black Marsh. His twin brother came
back to take over his affairs. Was as handsome
as his brother only with a wonky moustache.
Doesn't like women though which is a shame."

Message: 1033
"So?"

Message: 1034
"Are you going to ask?"

Message: 1044
"You've upset me now! I'm going to tell my dad."
<ce>
"DAAAAADDD! The %ra is rejecting me!"

Message: 1045
"What's going on! How dare you upset my daughter!"
<ce>
Lads! Protect her chastity!"

Message: 1046
"Oh. You must go? Must you? You will return?
We must plan our wedding my love. I know adventure
calls, but please don't be long!"

Message:  1047

%qdt:
_questgiver_ will give me the map if I help
%g2 steal a statue from _tailorhome_
in __tailorhome_. To do this I need to propose
to the tailor's daughter and swap the statue
with a fake. Then get out before they start
planning the wedding. I have =weddingsoff_ days to get
back to %g2 at __questgiver_ with loot.

Message: 1201
