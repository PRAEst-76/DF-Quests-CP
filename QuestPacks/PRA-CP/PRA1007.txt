QuestorOffer:  [1000]
%oth, you look like that %ra, %pcf. Is that you?
<--->
You're not by any chance %pcf, are you?
<--->
Wait a minute. You're not %pcf, are you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
Oh. I guess I was wrong.
<ce>
Sorry.
<--->
Really? Are you sure?
<ce>
I get a little confused sometimes.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Thief! Thiiiief! You're the one that took my gem!
Guards! Guaaards!

QuestFail:  [1003]
Real life is not for you. Best find a dungeon to die in.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
_questgiver_ should get help now.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I hear _questgiver_ has run off again.
<--->
_questgiver_ has had another one of %g3 turns.
<--->
Apparently some %ra spooked _questgiver_. Some people have no shame.
<--->
Some nutter is hiding under a table in _store_ and they can't get %g2 to come out.

--More Rumors
Message: 1011
A figure was seen sneaking out the back door of __store_'s _store_. Slunk off towards _res_ in __res_.

Message: 1012
I saw _questgiver_ leaving _res_ a short while ago. Looking furtive was %g. Seemed to head towards _remtav_ in __remtav_.

Message: 1013
My brother said he saw someone riding hell for leather out of __remtav_, heading towards _dun_.

Message: 1014
Someone was seen going into _dun_. Probably dead now.

--Quest Dialog
Message:  1050
As you hear the accusation, you wonder if perhaps
you did steal %g3 gem? However you have no
recollection of doing so.
<ce>
It might have been another %ra called %pcf...

Message:  1051
_questgiver_ has just scurried out the door.
No guards appear to be coming.
<ce>
You notice a local who glares at you and approaches.

Message:  1052
"%oth! What did you say to %g2?!"
<ce>
"You know what? It doesn't matter! _questgiver_
was doing well until some bloody %ra went and set
%g2 off again."
<ce>
"Well, go on! Go and find %g2 before %g hurts %g2self
or gets lost in a dungeon or something."

Message:  1053
"Try asking around town if anyone has seen %g2,
or they know anything of note."
<ce>
"Just bring %g2 to me at _house_
when you find %g2. Ask for _local0_."
<ce>
"If _questgiver_'s still in an agitated state
you may have to... subdue %g2. I'd say %g probably
needs a bit of a lie down."

Message: 1055
_questgiver_? Yes, %g was here. Wouldn't leave.
Hid under the table saying a %ra was trying
"inner-act" with %g2. Crazy if you ask me.
<ce>
Ran off towards _local2_'s house at
_res_. Glad to be shot of %g2.

Message:  1056
Yes. _questgiver_ was here. Hiding in the corner
there.
<ce>
Was here all night in fact. I offered %g2 some
food but %g just muttered about _remtav_
in __remtav_.
<ce>
You might want to check there.

Message:  1057
You still haven't found _questgiver_? As you can
see %g hasn't shown up here.
<ce>
Try asking if anyone has any news, if they can't
tell you about _questgiver_ directly.

Message:  1058
I'm sorry, you've just missed %g. Hid out in
corner. Left without paying %g3 bill I hear.
Seemed agitated.
<ce>
Talked about _dun_. That's not a nice place.

Message:  1059
No! It's you. What do you want from me? Leave me
alone!

Message:  1060
Please help me. I don't know how I got here. I
just want to go home.
<ce>
_local0_ sent you? Oh thank you. Please take me home!

Message:  1061
Glad you brought _questgiver_ back. %pcf.
I spoke to the Healer, _doctor_ from
__temple_ and they have something new
to try.
<ce>
Maybe bring %g2 there?

Message:  1062
%oth, you look like that worg, %n. Is that me?
<--->
You are by any chance %n, are we?
<--->
Wait a minute. You're not %n, we are?

Message:  1063
Ah, _questgiver_ I was expecting you.
I hear the potion we gave you has lost it's
effectiveness somewhat.
<ce>
Not to fear, we have a new one to try. It should
help keep those nasty thoughts at bay
<ce>
And thank you, %pcf, for bringing %g2 to us.
We can take it from here.

Message:  1064
This should cover your expenses.

%qdt:
_questgiver_ of ___questgiver_ suddenly
accused me of theft before calling the guards
and running out of the building screaming.
<ce>
I'm sure I'm probably innocent of this,
but will have to explain that to the guards.
<ce>
If they'll listen.

Message:  1151
%qdt:
No guards came. Instead _local0_
told me _questgiver_ has a few wheels
missing from %g3 cart.
<ce>
Apparently they now expect me to track %g2
down and bring %g2 to them at _house_.
<ce>
I'll need to ask around to figure out where %g
has run off to.

Message:  1152
%qdt:
_questgiver_ was at _store_ but apparently isn't
there anymore. I guess I need to ask around
again, see if anyone has seen %g2.

Message:  1153
%qdt:
_questgiver_ was here at _res_ but has left.
Who knows where. I guess I could ask people.

Message:  1154
%qdt:
Missed %g2 at _remtav_, but apparently
_questgiver_ was heard mumbling something
about _dun_. I best find them
before they get hurt.

Message:  1170
%qdt:
I found _questgiver_. Had to subdue %g2.
Now to get him back to _local0_
at _house_ in __house_ before he wakes up.

Message:  1156
%qdt:
I found _questgiver_ in _dun_. It appears
that %g has calmed down somewhat and wants to go
home. Now to get out.

Message:  1157
%qdt:
_local0_ has told me to take _questgiver_
to _temple_ in __temple_
where _doctor_ has a new treatment
for %g3 "condition".

--AnyInfo
Message:  1201
I hear _questgiver_ got thrown from a horse while travelling fast and says %g fell through the world and there was nothing there. Just a big void.
<--->
What I'd give to know about _questgiver_... no really. I'm writing a book about %g2. I think %g's an interesting character.
<--->
I talked to _questgiver_ once and %g told me none of us are real.
<--->
I had a good rumour about _questgiver_ but it got left out.
<--->
_questgiver_ has called for the guards so much they no longer get placed near %g2.
<--->
I hear some %ra has been asking questions about _questgiver_. Oh that's you? Sorry. That's all I know.
<--->
They say _questgiver_ is a liar, but if one believes their lies are the truth are they really lies? Something to think about.
<--->
Did _questgiver_ run off again? Sometimes %g hides out in _store_ when %g is having one of %g3 funny turns. Maybe look there.
<--->
I'd avoid _questgiver_ if I were you. Bit of a nutter that one.
<--->
_questgiver_ has some issues. I filed a report but it got closed.
<--->
_questgiver_ once told me that I looked rough because someone called Ninelan forgot about me. What a weird thing to say.
<--->
_questgiver_ has some creepy crawlies inside %g2. So %g says. Crazy talk.

Message: 1202
_local0_ is a decent sort. Always looking out for that poor _questgiver_. Lives at _house_ in __house_.


Message:  1250
%pcf
Sorry to have to tell you, but _questgiver_
was found dead in _dun_ by some adventurers
so you can call off your obviously thorough
search of the region.
<ce>
Be careful what you say to people in future, eh?

Message:  1300
A scruffy boy with a runny nose hands you a letter. Stares at you for a bit. Then wanders off.

Message:  1301
Damn. %g's awake again.

Message:  1302
_questgiver_ is unconscious. Time to get him home.

Message: 1303
There he is! There is _questgiver_!

Message: 1304
_questgiver_ almost instantaneously appears to
vanish before your eyes only to be replaced by
a raving _lunatic_ who attacks desperately.
<ce>
Metaphorically, of course.

Message: 1305
_questgiver_ has passed out again thankfully.
