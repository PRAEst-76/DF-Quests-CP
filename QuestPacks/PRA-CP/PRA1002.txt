QuestorOffer:  [1000]
You there %hnr! You seem like a capable
adventurer. I am _questgiver_, they call
me The Ratcatcher General. I'm the best
Ratcatcher in %reg. Ask anyone. It pains me
to admit this, but I need assistance. There is a
plague of rats in %cn and I'm struggling to
deal with them. I need you to keep the rats under
control while I poison their nests in three buildings.
Will you help? I will give you a sizable share of
the bounty. What say you, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:   [1001]
I don't blame you %pcf. Ratcatching is hard and
dirty work that often goes un-appreciated by
folk around here. I'll await another brave
adventurer.
Good travels my friend.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Good. We must make with haste for the first location,
_rathouse1_.
We need to clear them all within =timer_ days or the
rats will overrun %cn.

QuestFail:  [1003]
It's too late. The rats are out of control.
Flee for the hills!

QuestComplete:  [1004]
A great service we did today, %pcf. A great
service!
Here is your share of the bounty and have a drink
on me. You earned it. We made a good team.
I may call upon you again if the vermin
dare threaten our town.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Did you know _questgiver_ calls himself The Ratcatcher General? What a stupid title.

Message: 1021
This is the place, it stinks of _rats_ spoor!
<ce>
Take this bag of bait, it's a special mixture
of mine. Mostly rotting bones and dried fishguts
with some secret ingredients I add to give it
potency. Trade secrets I'm afraid, but it'll keep
the rats on you and, more importantly, off me
while I find their nest.
<ce>
They are likely to get mighty feisty once I start
messing with it, so be careful! And good luck!

Message: 1022
Ok. I've found the nest. Get ready, they'll get
ornery now!

Message: 1023
Ok. Here we are. Here is the bait.
Kill the rats, I'll do the nest.

Message: 1024
Right. Here's the bait. You know the drill.
We can get drunk after this.

Message:  1025
That's it! The first nest is dealt with. The rest of
the rats should be easy work, then we can go onto the
next, which is _rathouse2_.
<ce>
Be swift.
<ce>
I'll take the bag of bait back, otherwise you'll
have hungry _rats_ chasing you for days.

Message: 1026
Right. Second batch of nests dealt with.
I'll take the bait back.
Mop up any stragglers and then we need to
head for _rathouse3_. It's the last.

Message: 1027
All done my friend. Any rats that are left just
don't know they are dead yet. Let's go to the tavern.

Message: 1030
You've left _questgiver_ to %g3 fate. Without
your assistance %g is surely overcome by his
quarry.
<ce>
To make matters worst the bag of bait has burst
and covered you in it's contents. Rats will
follow you for hours.

Message: 1031
The stench must have mellowed somewhat now, as
rats no longer seem to be following.

Message:  1100
%qdt:
_questgiver_, who refers to %g2self as
The Ratcatcher General, has employed me to help
with a rat plague in %cn.
I am to escort %g2 to three buildings here and
slay rats while %g looks for the nests.
<ce>
We start with _rathouse1_.

Message: 1101
At _rathouse1_, _questgiver_ has given
me a reeking bag to use as bait to draw the rats
while %g looks for the nest.

Message: 1102
The first house has been dealt with, now onto the
next, which is _rathouse2_.

Message: 1103
Onto the last place now, which he tells me is
_rathouse3_

Message:  1105
We have dealt with all the infested houses.
_questgiver_ says we can go to the pub to
celebrate.

Message: 1104
%qdt:
I fled and left _questgiver_
alone with an angry horde of vermin. Surely %g'll
be done for. In a cruel twist of fate, the bag of
bait has split and emptied it's contents on my
clothes so now I'm drawing rats to me.
<ce>
I'll have to kill or run from them until the
stink wears off, hopefully in a few hours.
