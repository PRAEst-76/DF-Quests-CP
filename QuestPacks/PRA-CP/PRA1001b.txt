Message:  1050
%qdt:
I have received a letter from a priest called
_priest_ at _temple_
in __temple_.
It seems _questgiver_, who had an unfortunate and
surprising incident when he had me pull his finger for
a joke a number of weeks ago, is under his care.
He wishes me to come see him as soon as possible.

Message:  1051
%qdt:
_questgiver_ has been decimated by his condition.
_priest_ believes it's a curse and has sent
me with some kind of sample to bring to an Evoker
called _evoker_ in _tmg_
in __tmg_.

Message:  1052
%qdt:
_evoker_ is going to attempt to divine the
source of  the curse, however %g now requires me to
retrieve samples from two previous victims of a
similar curse.
<ce>
One is buried in ___grave_ in ____grave_.
The other is apparently in some ancient crypt in a place
called ___crypt_ in ____crypt_.

Message:  1053
%qdt:
The victim's wife was at the graveside. She seemed upset
so I decided to leave her alone and come back later when
she has gone, perhaps at night.

Message:  1054
%qdt:
The victim's wife was at the graveside. I explained
everything to her and she reluctantly agreed to me
taking the sample from her husband's corpse.

Message:  1060
%qdt:
The victim's wife was at the graveside. I explained
everything to her and she was horrified and set her
guards on me. Maybe I should come back later?

Message:  1061
%qdt:
Via some nocturnal gravedigging, I have retrieved the
sample from the first victim's corpse in the graveyeard.

Message:  1055
%qdt:
I have retrieved the sample from the second victim
whose body I found in ___crypt_.

Message:  1056
Now to return both samples to _evoker_
in _tmg_ in ___tmg_.

Message:  1057
_evoker_ is going to work on a cure. He will need some time.
I should come back tomorrow.

Message:  1058
_evoker_ has created a talisman which should
remove the curse somehow. I should get it back to
_priest_ at _temple_ in __temple_

Message:  1059
_questgiver_ is dying. _priest_ has
placed the talisman on him. We just need to wait now.

-- Dialogue
Message: 1101
"Ah, %pct. Thank you for coming.
_questgiver_ is stable for now but I'm not sure
how many more episodes his poor body can take. He has
been having these attacks for weeks. When he was lucid
he told me you were there for the first... er... spasm?"

Message:  1102
"I have never seen anything like this before, it appears
to be a particularly cruel curse that has been placed
upon him, perhaps by a vengeful business associate
or former lover."
<ce>
"If we could only..."

Message:  1103
"Each emergence leaves him more and more weakened.
There is only do much we can do here at the temple,
however I have been in corrispondence with the evoker,
_evoker_, at _tmg_ in __tmg_
who may be able to help with a treatment for the curse."
<ce>
"They will apparently require a sample of the emergence
sac to divinate it's nature. I will prepare the sample
which you must take them without delay."

Message:  1104
"Here is the sample. It is as fresh as possible. I have
sealed it in a jar. Do not lose this as I would rather
he not have to go through this again."

Message:  1105
"Please. Hurry to the evoker, _evoker_ and do
not become sidetracked. The mages can be wily and try
to lure you into other tasks and concerns."
<ce>
"Please focus on determining the nature of the curse.
And for _questgiver_'s sake, hurry the mage too.
They often care little for the lives of normal people."

Message:  1106
"Ah yes, you are from _temple_..."
<ce>
"You have the sample we requested? Good. I can set to
divining the kind of curse used. I believe there have
been two other cases of this recently."

Message:  1107
"The priest did not know this? I would have thought the
temples would be aware? I imagine they perhaps found
such demises so abhorrent to their frail sensitivies
that they deemed it prudent not to discuss them. To us
this is fascinating, of concern no doubt, but
fascinating nontheless."

Message:  1108
"Demises, I said? Deaths, yes."
<ce>
"I fear the victims have both perished as a result of
the curse. We didn't pay much heed to it at first,
but now with three such cases..."

Message:  1109
"I shall do what I can with what you have given me,
however it would expedite matters considerably should
we retrieve samples from the bowels of the previous
two victims."
<ce>
"An unpleasant task I know, but a necessary one."

Message:  1110
"The first is buried at ___grave_ and should be
simple for you to obtain."
<ce>
He holds up his hand before you can respond.
<ce>
"Yes. Lets not waste time on subtlties. You've come
this far. This is what needs to be done. By you. Now."

Message:  1111
"The second victim however left for his ancient family
crypt when realising the full extent of his situation
and presumably took his own life there out of some
sense of familial duty... unless he was killed by the
denizens such places usually contain."
<ce>
"Go to ___crypt_, find his body and obtain the
sample. Otherwise who knows how long divining the
source might take."

Message:  1112
"Are you still here?"

Message:  1113
"Who are you? Why are you here? Did you know my husband?"
<ce>
<ce>Tell her the truth?

Message:  1114
"They are trying to find a cure? Why? My husband is
dead. How can it help him now?"

Message:  1115
"Others? Oh no. Who would do this?
What do you need of me?"
<ce>
<ce>Tell her what you need to do as sensitively as you can?

Message:  1119
"Then why are you harrasing me at my husband's graveside
if there is nothing you can do?! Begone from me!"

Message:  1116
"What?! No! That..."
"You... Do... Do what you must!
Please ensure no-one else suffers as he did.
Just see that you leave his grave as it was."

Message:  1117
"He was a good man. He didn't deserve this.
The children think he is away in Skyrim on business.
I'm not ready to tell them.
Please. I don't mean to be rude,
but I wish to be alone with my husband."

Message:  1118
"What?! No! That..."
"No, that is monsterous! I will not allow it.
Get away from me!
Not! Allow!
Guards! Guards!!"

Message:  1125
"Move along buddy! Leave the lady alone."

Message:  1126
"Halt!"

Message: 1120
"Well, what do we have here? A %ra, from the crypt?"
<ce>
"We were going to rob that crypt. It was our plan.
How abouts you just hand over what you've found down there.
Like that jar. Bet that's something important. Give us it!"
<ce>
Give them the sample?

Message: 1122
"Great. Thanks. A smart %ra, who'd have known?"
<ce>
"Gonna need the rest of your stuff too.
Nothing personal, we're just greedy like that."

Message: 1121
"Ooh. You know, that's not fair. We planned this raid weeks ago.
This is our crypt. We got dressed up and everything this morning.
%rn even made us snacks for the trip!
Was up from cock-crow wrapping them up nice in parchment paper.
You really owe us."

Message: 1123
"Nah. Sod that. How about we takes everything?
Guys, let's upend this fool and see what falls out!"

Message: 1124
"I'm sad that you've made this so diffuclt.
Guys, let's upend this fool and see what falls out!"

Message: 1130
"Ah. You have returned. You have the... excellent.
I'll get to work right away, of course, this would
be even quicker if I had the other sample.
Hint, hint!"

Message: 1131
"I know what you are thinking. I have started
divining the initial specimen. I just like to
keep things tidy. Some of my colleagues work
in chaos. Not me. I like to remain focused."
"Now get me that last sample."

Message: 1140
"Ah, the final sample. You were able to retrieve it?"
"Excellent, most excellent. With all three specimens I should be
able to triangulate the source of the curse."

Message: 1141
"This will take some time. I know we do not have that so spare so
I will be as expedient as my craft allows."
"Please, return tomorrow at this time. I should have some 
information for you then, but not before.
I'm sure you can busy yourself in the interim."

Message: 1150
"I have... done all I can. This has not been easy.
The source of the curse has been elusive. I'll admit,
this is unlike any curse I have seen before. I will need
to write a journal for the council on this when
time allows."

Message: 1151
"However, I believe I have created a cure. I have infused
this amulet with a powerful curse removal spell focused
on the energies from the samples you supplied. If the
victim wears this it should drive the curse from them."

Message: 1152
"Please let me know if this works. I mean... I have no doubt
that it will, but... you know? The journal? I could get a
grant for further research."

Message: 1160
"%pcf. I fear I do not have good news. _questgiver_
succumbed during the night. I was to write you with
the news but did not get the time due to clerical
praparations.
I fear even had you arrived sooner it may have still
been too late. This foul curse took such a toll upon 
his body that he would have perished eventually."

Message: 1161
"You have the... ah. Yes. I see. A talisman. If I may
take it from you? I soon ride for the coast. There have
been reports of a possibly similar case there involving
a child. I will take the item to them. Perhaps it may
save a life yet."

Message: 1162
"%pcf! You have returned. Do you have..?"
<ce>
"A talisman. And they said this should allevite the
curse?"
<ce>
"We shall try, though I fear _questgiver_
has been weakened greatly by his ordeal.

Message: 1163
"%pcf. I fear I do not have good news.
_questgiver_ succumbed during the night.
However he had no further attacks and passed
peacefully in his sleep, so at least the talisman
allowed him that final respite."

Message: 1164
"I shall take it and soon ride for the coast.
There have been reports of a possibly similar case
there involving a child.
I will take it to them.
It may save a life yet."

Message: 1165
"I shall report any results to _evoker_ as I'm sure
they requested."

Message:  1166
The temple does not have much to spare, however I feel
you have earned this gold for all you have done.
We may not have helped _questgiver_ but I'm sure
all you have done will have helped others.
I can assure you of that.

Message:  1167
Goodbye %pcf. I hope you never have to encounter such foulness
again, but if you do, you will know where to find me."

-- Corrispondence
Message:  1201
Dear %pcf,
My name is _priest_ at _temple_
in __temple_.
I am writing to you as you previously assisted a man
here called _questgiver_ with a personal problem.
<ce>
I sadly have to inform you that his condition has severely
worsened and he is now in our care. He does not wish the
nature of his illness to become widely known and as such
has requested your assistance in helping us treat him.
He has added that he can renumerate you for your time if
that helps.
<ce>
If you can assist us in our investigation into his ailment
I would be very appreciative but advise you to make haste
to us here in the temple as we fear that any worsening in
his condition may be fatal.
<ce>
                            Gods bless.
                            _priest_
                             _temple_
                              __temple_

Message:  1202
Dear %pcf,
I am unfortunately the bearer of bad news. I'm afraid
_questgiver_ died this evening.
<ce>
We kept him as comfortable as we could but I cannot lie
and say his death was not unpleasant. He suffered greatly.
<ce>
I hope that your visit to the mages was productive, but
alas can do nothing to help my patient, who at least is
beyond suffering now. Perhaps any research the envoker
was able to perform may help with any future cases, of
which I hope there is none. I wish you good journeys.
<ce>
                            Gods bless.
                            _priest_
                             _temple_
                              __temple_

-- Notifications
Message:  1301
<ce>A messenger appears as if out of nowhere and silently
<ce>holds out a letter addressed to you.
<ce>
<ce>Without awaiting approval or a gratuity he dissapears
<ce>almost as quickly.

Message:  1321
<ce>Seems _questgiver_ is in a bad way.
<ce>_priest_ wants me to go to
<ce>_temple_ in __temple_ immediately.

Message:  1302
<ce>You look up and the silent messenger is before you.
<ce>They barely nods, then dissapears. Almost as if by magic.
<ce>Looking down you realise you hold a letter.

Message:  1303
<ce>You look at the small figure asleep in the bed.
<ce>The man is noticeably more emaciated than he was when you
<ce>last saw him. The humour has gone from his face, which is
<ce>of a grey pallor. His eyes are dark and sunken. He looks
<ce>at least 20 years older, despite it being a matter of weeks.
<ce>He shakes in his slumber like a brittle tree in a storm.

Message: 1304
<ce>The man stirs then his eyes open and he starts to moan.
<ce>
"Ohhh. Ohhh nooo! Nooooo!"

Message: 1305
<ce>The priest tries to hold _questgiver_ down while inserting
<ce>a wooden spoon between his teeth.
<ce>
"Quickly. Deal with that comes! I'll try to keep him calm."

Message:  1306
<ce>The foul creature is dead. _questgiver_ is
<ce>unconscious again. His breathing ragged.

Message:  1307
<ce>The priest carefull uses a flat knife to scrape some of
<ce>the homunculous' birth sac from the bed into a jar. He
<ce>carefully seals it with a cork, wraps it in a cloth,
<ce>ties some twine around it and hands it to you.

Message:  1308
<ce>The evoker takes the jar from you and sets it carefully
<ce>on a table behind him. He then proceeds to carefully
<ce>ignore it and continues talking.

Message:  1309
<ce>Arriving at the grave of the first victim you notice a
<ce>woman, tending to the flowers placed there.
<ce>She looks up in surprise as you approach.

Message:  1316
<ce>She turns from you in visible distress.
<ce>You notice some guards coming over.

Message:  1315
<ce>The graveyard is deserted. Time to get to work.

Message:  1314
<ce>You leave her to her grief. You will need to return
<ce>later when she is gone. Perhaps in a few hours.

Message:  1310
<ce>She looks horrified when you tell her.

Message:  1327
<ce>Looks like some of the residents are upset that you
<ce>are wandering around at night.

Message:  1328
<ce>The graveyard tenants have been put back to bed.

Message:  1317
<ce>It takes a while to dig deep enough, but you uncover the
<ce>dessicated corpse and use a knife to remove a section of
<ce>bowel which you place in a jar.
<ce>Then you fill the grave in again.

Message:  1318
<ce>This is the place. The second victim fled here.
<ce>I'll find his remains inside somewhere. 

Message:  1319
<ce>This is the second victim. Looks like the denizens of
<ce>this place have largely left the corpse alone.
<ce>You wonder why.

Message:  1320
<ce>The bowel appears intact. You use the knife to cut
<ce>some off into a jar.

Message:  1324
<ce>Now to get the samples back to _evoker_ in ___tmg_

Message: 1311
<ce>Upon leaving the crypt you are approached by a rough
<ce>looking adventuring party.

Message:  1326
<ce>You had the jar to the _partyt_.
<ce>All that work for nothing.

Message: 1312
<ce>_evoker_ takes the jar from you and places it on his
<ce>table next to the other.
<ce>You wonder if he's actually done anything with it.

Message:  1323
<ce>I should give him time to work and come back this
<ce>time tomorrow.

Message: 1313
<ce>Offer them some money to leave you alone?

Message:  1322
<ce>I've upset her and now some guards are here.
<ce>Probably best to leave her alone and come back later
<ce>when they've all gone.

Message:  1325
<ce>I should check on _evoker_. Time is running out for _questgiver_
