Message:  1050
I have received a leeter from a priest called
_priest_ at _temple_ in __temple_.
It seems _questgiver_, who had an unfortunate and
surprising incident when he had me pull his finger a
number of weeks ago, is under his care.
He wishes me to come see him as soon as possible.

Message:  1051
_questgiver_ has been decimated by his condition.
_priest_ believes it's a curse and has sent me with
some kind of sample to bring to an Evoker called
_evoker_ in _tmg_ in __tmg_.

Message:  1052
_evoker_ is going to attempt to divine the source of 
the curse, however requires me to retrieve samples
from two previous victims of a similar curse.
One is buried in _grave_ in ____grave_.
The other is apparently in some ancient crypt called
_crypt_ in ____crypt_.

Message:  1053
The victim's wife was at the graveside. She seemed upset
so I decided to leave her alone and come back later when
she has gone, perhaps at night.

Message:  1054
The victim's wife was at the graveside. I explained
everything to her and she reluctantly agreed to me
taking the sample from her husband's corpse.

-- Dialogue
Message: 1101
"Ah, %pct. Thank you for coming.
_questgiver_ is stable for now but I'm not sure
how many more episodes his poor body can take. He has
been having these attacks for weeks. When he was lucid
he told me you were there for the first... er... spasm?"

Message:  1102
"I have never seen anything like this before, it appears
to be a particularly cruel curse that has been placed
upon him, perhaps by a vengeful business associate
or former lover."
<ce>
"If we could only..."

Message:  1103
"Each emergence leaves him more and more weakened.
There is only do much we can do here at the temple,
however the evoker, _evoker_, at _tmg_ in
__tmg_ may be able to help with a treatment
for the curse.
They will apparently require a sample of the emergence
sac to divinate it's nature.
I will prepare the sample which you must take them
without delay."

Message:  1104
"Here is the sample. It is as fresh as possible.
I have sealed it in a jar. Do not lose this as I
would rather he not have to go through this again."

Message:  1105
"Please. Hurry to the evoker, _evoker_.
Do not become sidetracked. The mages can be wily and
try to lure you into other tasks and concerns.
Please focus on determining the nature of the curse.
For _questgiver_'s sake. Hurry _evoker_ too.
Mages often care little for the lives of normal people."

Message:  1106
"Ah yes, you are from _temple_...
You have the sample we requested? Good. I can set to
divining the kind of curse used.
I believe there have been two other cases of this
recently."

Message:  1107
"The priest did not know this? I would have thought the
temples would be aware? I imagine they perhaps found
such demises so abhorrent to their frail sensitivies
that they deemed it prudent not to discuss them.
<ce>
To us this is fascinating, of concern no doubt,
but fascinating nontheless.

Message:  1108
"Demises? Deaths, yes."
<ce>
"I fear the victims have both perished as a result of
the curse. We didn't pay much heed to it at first,
but now with three such cases..."

Message:  1109
"I shall do what I can with what you have given me,
however it would expedite matters considerably should
we retrieve samples from the bowels of the previous
two victims."
<ce>
"An unpleasant task I know, but a necessary one."

Message:  1110
"The first is buried at ___grave_ and should be
simple for you to obtain."
<ce>
He holds up his hand before you can respond.
<ce>
"Yes. Lets not waste time on subtlties. You've come
this far. This is what needs to be done. By you. Now."

Message:  1111
"The second victim however left for his ancient family
crypt when realising the full extent of his situation
and presumably took his own life there out of some
sense of familial duty...
unless he was killed by the denizens such places usually
contain."
<ce>
"Go to _crypt_, find his body and obtain the sample.
Otherwise who knows how long divining the source might take."

Message:  1112
"Are you still here?"

Message:  1113
Who are you? Why are you here? Did you know my husband?
<ce>
<ce>Tell her the truth?

Message:  1114
"They are trying to find a cure? Why? My husband is dead. How can it help him now?"

Message:  1115
Others? Oh no. Who would do this?
<ce>
What do you need of me?
<ce>
<ce>Tell her what you need to do as sensitively as you can?

Message:  1119
Then why are you harrasing me at my husband's graveside
if there is nothing you can do?!
Begone from me!

Message:  1116
What?! No! That...
<ce>
You... Do... Do what you must!
Please ensure no-one else suffers as he did.
Just see that you leave is grave as it was.

Message:  1117
He was a good man. He didn't deserve this. The children think he is away in Skyrim on business. I'm not ready to tell them.
Please. I don't mean to be rude, but I wish to be alone with my husband.

Message:  1118
What?! No! That...
<ce>
No, that is monsterous! I will not allow it.
Get away from me!
Not! Allow!
Guards! Guards!!

Message: 1120
"Well, what do we have here? A %ra, from the crypt?"
"We were going to rob that crypt. It was our plan.
How abouts you just hand over what you've found down there.
Like that jar. Bet that's something important. Give us it!"

Message: 1121
"Ooh. You know, that's not fair. We planned this raid weeks ago.
This is our crypt. We got dressed up and everything this morning.
%rn even made us snacks for the trip!
Was up from cock-crow wrapping them up nice in parchment paper.
You really owe us."

Message: 1122
"Nah. Sod that. How about we takes everything?
Guys, let's upend this fool and see what falls out!"

Message: 1123
"I'm sad that you've made this so diffuclt.
Guys, let's upend this fool and see what falls out!"

Message: 1124
"Ah. You have returned. You have the... excellent.
I'll get to work right away, of course, this would
be even quicker if I had the other sample.
Hint, hint!"

Message: 1125
"I know what you are thinking. I have started
divining the initial specimen. I just like to
keep things tidy. Some of my colleagues work
in chaos. Not me. I like to remain focused."
"Now get me that last sample."

Message: 1126
"Welcome back. Now, the final sample. You were able to retrieve it?"
"Excellent, most excellent. With all three specimens I should be
able to triangulate the source of the curse."

Message: 1127
"This will take some time. I know we do not have that so spare so
I will be as expedient as my craft allows."
"Please, return tomorrow at this time. I should have some 
information for you then, but not before.
I'm sure you can busy yourself in the interim."

Message: 1128
"I have... done all I can. This has not been easy.
The source of the curse has been elusive. I'll admit,
this is unlike any curse I have seen before. I will need
to write a journal for the council on this when
time allows."
"However, I believe I have created a cure. I have infused
this amulet with a powerful curse removal spell focused
on the energies from the samples you supplied. If the
victim wears this it should drive the curse from them."

Message: 1129
"Please let me know if this works. I mean... I have no doubt
that it will, but... you know? The journal? I could get a
grant for further research."

Message: 1130
"%pcf. I fear I do not have good news. _questgiver_
succumbed yesterday. I was to write you with the news but
did not get the time due to clerical praparations.
I fear even had you arrived sooner it may have still
been too late. This foul curse took such a toll upon 
his body that he would have perished eventually."

Message: 1131
"You have the... ah. Yes. I see. A talisman. If I may
take it from you? I ride for the coast. There have
been reports of a possibly similar case there involving
a child. I will take the item to them. Perhaps it may
save a life yet."

Message: 1132
"I shall report any results to _evoker_ as I'm sure they requested.
Here is payment for the work you have done, for _temple_
and poor _questgiver_.
Goodbye %pcf. I hope you never have to encounter such foulness
again, but if you do, you will know where to find me."

-- Corrispondence
Message:  1201
Dear %pcf,
My name is _priest_ at _temple_ in
__temple_.
I am writing to you as you previously assisted a man
here called _questgiver_ with a personal problem.
I sadly have to inform you that his condition has
severely worsened and he is now in our care.
He does not wish the nature of his illness to become
widely known and as such has requested your assistance
in helping us treat him. He has added that he can
renumerate you for your time if it helps.
If you can assist us in our investigation into his
ailment I would be very appreciative but advise you
to make haste to us here in the temple as we fear
that any worsening in his condition may be fatal.
<ce>
                            Gods bless.
                            _priest_

Message:  1202
Dear %pcf,
I'm afraid _questgiver_ died this evening.
We kept him as comfortable as we could but I cannot lie
and say his death was not unpleasant.
He suffered greatly.
I hope that your visit to the mages was productive, but
alas can do nothing to help my patient, who at least is
beyond suffering now.
Perhaps any research the envoker was able to perform may
help with any future cases, of which I hope there is none.
I wish you good journeys.
<ce>
                            Gods bless.
                            _priest_

-- Notifications
Message:  1301
A messenger appears as if out of nowhere and silently
holds out a letter addressed to you.
Without awaiting approval or a gratuity he dissapears
almost as quickly.

Message:  1313
Seems _questgiver_ is in a bad way. _priest_ wants me
to go to _temple_ in __temple_ immediately.

Message:  1302
You look up and the silent messenger is before you.
He barely nods and then dissapears, almost as if by magic.
Looking down you realise you hold a letter.

Message:  1303
You look at the small figure asleep in the bed.
The man is noticeably more emaciated than he was when you
last saw him. The humour has gone from his face, which is
of a grey pallor. His eyes are dark and sunken. He looks
at least 20 years older, despite it being a matter of weeks.
He shakes in his slumber like a brittle tree in a storm.

Message: 1304
The man stirs then his eyes open and he starts to moan.
<ce>
"Ohhh. Ohhh nooo! Nooooo!"

Message: 1305
The priest tries to hold _questgiver_ down while inserting
a wooden spoon between his teeth.
"Quickly. Deal with that comes! I'll try to keep him calm."

Message:  1306
The foul creature is dead. _questgiver_ is
unconscious again. His breathing ragged.

Message:  1307
The priest carefull uses a flat knife to scrape some of
the homunculous' birth sac from the bed into a jar. He
carefully seals it with a cork, wraps it in a cloth,
ties some twine around it and hands it to you.

Message:  1308
The evoker takes the jar from you and sets it carefully
on a table behind him. He then proceeds to carefully
ignore it and continues talking.

Message:  1309
Arriving at the grave of the first victim you notice a
woman, tending to the flowers placed there.
She looks up in surprise as you approach.

Message:  1316
She turns from you in visible distress. You notice some guards coming over.

Message:  1315
The graveyard is deserted. Time to get to work.

Message:  1314
You leave her to her grief. You will need to return later when she is gone. Perhaps in a few hours.

Message:  1310
She looks horrified when you tell her.

Message:  1317
It takes a while to dig deep enough, but you uncover the dessicated corpse and use a knife to remove a second of bowel. Then you fill the grave in again.

Message:  1318
This is the place. The second victim fled here. I'll find his remains inside somewhere. 

Message: 1311
Upon leaving the crypt you are approached by a rough looking adventuring party.

Message: 1312
<ce>_evoker_ takes the jar from you and places it on his
<ce>table next to the other.
<ce>You wonder if he's actually done anything with it.
