Message: 1021
"My daughter? Well I. Yes. My only child. This farm will
all be hers when I go, and of course that will be
shared with her spouse. Whoever that may be..."

good %t and I will  go and fetch her. I er...
believe she is dressing as we speak."

Message:  1023

leave you two alone to get... better aquainted."

Message:  1024
"Good %t. I'm afraid I am a somewhat shy girl.
I know not what to say to %pct like yourself.
I have lived here on ___farmhome_ all my life.
Many have come to attempt to woo me buit none
such as you, boorish bankers and shifty men after
my fathers' deeds."

Message: 1025
"But you. You are an adventurer! What an exciting
life you must lead %t! Not like the life on a farm."

Message: 1026
"I'd love to live a life of excitement and adventue,
it's so boring here living with my dad. He wants me
to be some tawdry goodwife to a toff, but I want to
run away and have adventures."

Message: 1027
"Maybe you could take me away? Do you have a horse?"

Message: 1028
"I've ridden before. Dad thinks I haven't but one
of the stableboys took me to the stables. I've
been riding regularly with the boys in secret.
Don't tell dad!"

Message: 1029
"I'd love to ride with you. Into the wilds. Wildness
excites me. There's no wildness here. It's dull."

Message: 1030
"Have you got anything to say to me? Any formal
question to ask?"

Message: 1031
"I tell you about myself and then you ask your
question and I say yes and then you need to go
on urgent business in another country and then
we get a letter saying you were eaten by a
troll."

Message: 1032
"That happened with Lord Marwyen. Got ate
by a troll in Black Marsh. His twin brother came
back to take over his affairs. Was as handsome
as his brother only with a wonky moustache.
Doesn't like women though which is a shame."

Message: 1033
"So?"

"DAAAAADDD! The %ra is rejecting me!"

Message: 1045
"What's going on! How dare you upset my daughter!"

calls, but please don't be long!"
