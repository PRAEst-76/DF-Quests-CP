<ce>Is this the end for The Ratcatcher General?

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The rat problem seems to get worse when that Ratcatcher is in town. Just sayin'.
<--->
Ratcatcher says there is no such thing as a Rat King.
<--->
My cousin had rats but the Ratcatcher killed them.
<--->
I heard the Ratcatcher eats the rats. His wife left him when she found out.

Message:  1010
His home is the road he says. I hear it's 'cause his wife kicked him out 'cause he smells like rodent.
<--->
My brother says he releases the rats first then comes round to 'catch' 'em and charge folk.
<--->
If you don't pay him he takes your kids. Someone told me.
<--->
He's decent enough, bit rough around the edges.

Message:  1011
Owns _tav_ but doesn't run it. Just counts the money.
<--->
The ladies seem to be fond of him. Can't think why. Other than his gold.
<--->
I've heard he's got a collection of trophies from his conquests. Some say he just steals them from washing lines at night.

Message:  1012
You don't want to talk to that one. The Dark Brotherhood would kill for a knife as sharp as his tongue.
<--->
He smells like an old woman who fell in a rosebush.
<--->
Another one of those frock wearing freaks up at the horror farm. That's what my dad calls it.
<--->
Always got his nose in a book that one. I don't think he's reading them, he just likes to sniff the pages.
<--->
Was icy a few years back and me and some lads saw him slip and fall on his arse. We laughed so hard, but the look he gave us haunts me to this day.

Message:  1013
Nice girl. Haven't seen her or her mum around for a long time though.
<--->
Oh. She used to help the old Ratcatcher out. May have been his kid. Haven't seen her in a long time, now I think of it. Hope she wasn't eaten.
<--->
I remember her. Smart girl. I guess she went off to better things.

Message:  1014
Oh. The old Ratcatcher's wife. I think she left him for a wealthy man from abroad.
<--->
That snooty cow. Had airs, but we all rmemember she married a man who caught rats. And she knew it.
<--->
The Ratcatcher's wife. Heard she caught the old man with a girl young enough to be his daughter.

%qdt:
I've received a badly written letter that seems to
be from my old friend _questgiver_, who calls himself
The Ratcatcher General.
<ce>
He wants me to meet him in __tav_ within
 =ignore_ days to discuss the growing rat problem.

Message:  1051
%qdt:
I found _questgiver_ in _tav_ worse for
wear. There was a small altercation and I've had to take
him to his rooms to sleep it off. I should go by in the
morning and see if he's making any more sense then.

Message: 1052
%qdt:
_questgiver_ can't do anything until his bar tab has
been paid at _tav_. He owes _bartab_ gold.
I may have to pay it for him.

Message:  1059
%qdt:
The owner of _tav_, _barkeep_,
says he'll settle the debts for _questgiver_
if I do him a favour.
<ce>
Says it's simple and above board...

Message:  1053
%qdt:
I've helped _questgiver_ settle his bartab. Now we
can get down to business.

Message: 1054
%qdt:
_questgiver_ thinks the rats are behaving
strangely. He wants us to catch one of the horde at a
place called ___hamlet_ and take it to The Mages Guild
where they will perform some tests.

Message:  1055
%qdt:
We've got a rat in a bag, now to get it back to
_mages_ in __mages_ so they can run tests.

Message:  1060
%qdt:
We lost the rat, have to do that all over again at
_hamlet2_.

Message:  1056
%qdt:
_mages_ had been attacked by rats again. We had to
kill them. They will reluctantly run the test, but it
will take a week. I guess I should get on with other
things in the meantime.

Message:  1057
%qdt:
_mages_ has been attacked again. They contacted us
and told us to return straight away.

Message:  1058
%qdt:
The tests by _sarcmage_ at _mages_ showed no
magical cause behind the rats. They implied The
Ratcatcher General was causing the rat attacks himself,
conscuously or unconsciously. He is understandably
shaken and wants to go to a tavern.

Message:  1100
<ce>This is __tav_ Now to find _questgiver_,
<ce>AKA The Ratcatcher General.

Message:  1101
<ce>From what you remember of him, it might be worth
<ce>checking the taverns first.

Message:  1192
<ce>A messenger approaches and hands you a letter.

Message:  1193
<ce>This badly written letter is from The Ratcatcher
<ce>General, looks like he is somewhere in
<ce>__tav_ in ____tav_ and needs your help again.

Message:  1194
<ce>I think the Ratcatcher General will have gave up
<ce>on me by now.

Message:  1191
<ce>Forgot all about The Ratcatcher General. Oh well.

Message:  1102
As you enter a voice rings out, "There %pg is! %pcf!
My old buddy-in-arms!"
<ce>
It's _questgiver_, the self-styled Ratcatcher General.
And %g is obviously very, very drunk.
<ce>
"%pcf! Over here! Wait 'til you lads see what %pg can do!"
"Hey %pcf! Destroy that table!"

Message:  1103
"Sit down _questgiver_, before you fall down!"
yells the barman.
<ce>
"You a friend of %g3? Fool's been drinking for days.
Making a right mess here %g has. You're here now. Deal
with %g2."

Message:  1104
The Ratchacher spins on %g3 heel and points %g3 finger
at the place the barman would have been if the barman
had been somewhere else entirely.
<ce>
"You don't... never speak to %pcf like that! Never!
%pcf is my comrade! We slew many beasts together..."

Message:  1105
A shabby man sitting near the door responds,
"You killed many rats, mate. My dog does that and he's
got a gammy leg and can't see 'owt."

Message:  1106
"You know nothing of our quarry %mn!
Nothing!" the Ratcatcher yells in the man's vague
direction. "Come on! Come with us now! See what we face!
You'll fill your old britches quick enough!"

Message:  1107
The barman addresses you again with more urgency,
"Seriously %ra, shut %g2 up or get %g2 out."

Message:  1108
"C'mon.... All of you. Let's go face our quarry. I'll
show you the horrors that skulk in your homes when you
slumber! Nibbling the fingers of your babes!"
<ce>
<ce>Make %g2 shut up?

Message:  1109
You put your hand on %g3 shoulder and %g1 spins around,
loses %g3 balance and lands on the floor, tries to get
up, fails miserably, then goes to sleep like a crumpled
up corpse.

Message:  1110
The barman claps his hands together, "Right. Well that's
%g2 shut up. Get %g2 to %g3 room %ra. When %g1 wakes up
in the morning, get %g2 the hells out. You can have
%g3 gear once %g3 tab is paid ...and it's not pretty."

Message:  1111
"Rats are smarter than you think. Smarter than all of
you!"
<ce>
The barman booms at you, "%ra!"

Message:  1112
A large man sitting at a table nearby slams down his
tankard and stands up, "You're not smarter than my
fist Ratmuncher!"
<ce>
He takes a swing at the Ratcatcher who accidentally
sways out of the way and the fist hits you instead.

Message:  1113
The fight over you look around to see where the
_questgiver_ is and find %g2 passed out in the corner.
You would think %g2 dead if it wasn't for %g2 snoring
like an elderly bear

Message:  1114
You should probably take %g2 to a bed here to sleep it off.

Message:  1115
_questgiver_ is limp like a corpse and weighs more than
%g looks.

Message:  1116
You dump _questgiver_ in %g3 room on the bed.
In %g3 sleep %g mumbles something a king, farts and
rolls over.
<ce>
Best give %g2 time to sleep it off.

Message:  1117
I should maybe check on _questgiver_.

Message:  1118
"Oh, hello %pcf. You got my letter then? Good.
I was wondering when you would show up. I was almost
getting my things ready to leave."
<ce>
Obviously he doesn't have any recollection of the
previous day, probably for the best.

Message:  1162
"Slight problem there though. My... host, a lovely man
here called _barkeep_ took my gear while
I was... indesposed and won't return it until I settle
up with him. Sad fact is, I don't have that kind of
gold right now."
<ce>
"Perhaps you could have a word with him for me?
Maybe talk him round?"
<ce>
"Oh, speak of the demon..."

Message: 1120
"I suppose you've come for _questgiver_'s gear?
As you were told last night, he gets it back when he's
settled the tab. Which is _bartab_ gold."
<ce>
<ce>Try to talk the landlord down?

Message: 1121
"No doing. He caused damage during his stay. Both to the
furniture and my tavern's reputation. Do you think
everyone wants to hear the ins and outs of killing rats
every night? I'd almost swear he was planted here by the
competition."
<ce>
"He gets his rat killing stuff back when I get _bartab_ gold
in my hand. Either from him or from you."
<ce>
<ce>Pay his tab?

Message: 1122
"Look. I've nothing against the guy. I feel sorry for
him, really. No-one cares for rat-catchers, but it's a
necessary job. I want him out of here as much as you do.
I've got a business to run."
<ce>
"Tell you what, I'll take 75g. Call it even."
<ce>
<ce>Pay the reduced tab?

Message: 1123
"Look. I want him out, he's caused chaos since he's been here.
If he's not offending the customers with stories about killin'
rats, he's depressing them with stories about how his killin'
rats drove away his missus..."
<ce>
"Tell you what. Do a little favour for me and I'll wipe the tab
and let you have his gear? It's nothing dangerous or illegal,
really. Deal?"

Message:  1165
"Are you ready to pay up?"

Message:  1171
"Ha! Great work %pcf! Great work! I'll see the fallout
from these schenanigans soon enough."

Message: 1172
"I gave you a simple task. Not simple enough it seems."

Message:  1160
"Right! Here's his stuff. Glad to be shot of the stinking
stuff. Now take him and get out. He's not welcome back
here again."

Message: 1124
"Ok, well I tried to be reasonable. I need that tab
covered IN FULL within the week, or I sell his gear to
recoup my losses. Not that it will."
<ce>
"Oh, and he's not to come back here again."

Message:  1161
"Well, _barkeep_ will have sold or dumped my stuff by now.
That's me out of the game.
Been nice knowing you _questgiver_ but I'm off to live
under a bridge."

Message: 1125
"I can't do ratcatching without my gear %pcf. Can't even
make the money without being able to catch rats.
No idea how we can get our hands on that amount of gold
within a week."

Message: 1126
"I'll make it up to you %pcf, I promise. Anyway,
I got a job for us. Place called ___hamlet_, major
issue with these vindictive rats. Going to need to try
something different this time. Going to take one of these
buggers alive. Got a mage friend who owes me for
clearing his guild a while ago. He's going to cast some
magicks on the thing and see what evil is driving it.
Some evil is driving these things now. I swear."

Message: 1127
"That rat in the bag? It's dead. We'll need to get
another. Head to _hamlet2_."
<--->
"Dammit. the rat escaped. We'll need to get another
one. We really dn't have time for this %pcf.
Go to _hamlet2_"

Message: 1128
"OK. Got one. Festy bugger. I'll take back the bait, you
take the ratbag. Now to get it back to _sarcmage_
at _mages_ in __mages_ before he manages to chew his way
out of that bag."

Message: 1129
Dammit. He got out.

Message: 1130
Let's try that again.

Message: 1131
"_questgiver_! Look here everyone. The great Ratchatcher
General is back!"

Message: 1132
"Ok, yeah. I rememeber. I said I'd help you look into
this rat plague as a favour for helping us with our rat
problem."
<ce>
"Do you see where I'm going with this? Maybe the
scrabbling in the walls or the incesant squeaking might
help."

Message: 1133
"Yes _sarcmage_ I hear you."
The Ratcatcher turns to you, "Ok %pcf, looks like
things are getting worse. We need to clear this place
again. I don't know why the creatures have returned so
soon. I cleared this place weeks ago. I swear. They
usually don't return this quickly."

Message: 1134
"Well, thanks _questgiver_... You've dealt with our rat
problem. Again. How on Nirn can we ever repay you...
again... etc..." he tosses an almost impossibly small
bag of gold to the Ratcatcher who catches it
absentmindedly. You wonder if it even holds enough gold
to cover the cost of the bag.
<ce>
"Where's the live one we needed?" he snaps.

Message: 1135
The Ratcatcher snaps back, "This place was swarming with
the buggers! Why did you need me to drag one half-way
across ____mages_ when you could have just picked
one up off the floor?!"

Message: 1136
"We're mages, _questgiver_, not Ratcatchers! Wouldn't
want to step on your toes and have the full weight of
the Ratcatchers Guild ontop of us."

Message: 1137
"Ok, enough sarcasm, _sarcmage_. Here's your bagged
rat. See if you can find out what magicks is driving
these things."

Message: 1138
"Have you ever thought that maybe they've just set up a
rival guild? Maybe you should speak to The Rat King and
work out a job share arrangement?"

Message: 1139
"Shut up about The Rat King! There's no such thing as a
rat king!"

Message: 1140
"Just because you haven't seen one doesn't mean they
don't exist. I've never seen the lady that cleans out
our latrines, but I'm sure she exists."

Message: 1141
"Look, just do your magicks on the rat and let me know
what you find. It won't be no rat king. Probably
something one of you lot did messing about with things
that your noses don't belong in."

Message: 1142
"Don't have time for things like that, believe it or not 
_questgiver_... with all the problems the likes of you
dump on us to fix yet somehow manage to blame us for."

Message: 1143
"Two attacks in... what? A month? I know I brag but once
I clear a house it stays cleared, usually for years. I
killed all your rats. These ones... they came after.
Like they was wanting something."

Message: 1144
"I'm as curious as you Ratcatcher. You may be barely
human and smell like horsewinkle, but you are good at
what you do. Give me a week."

Message:  1166
"Right. I expect a lot of information on that rat a week
from now _sarcmage_!"

Message: 1145
You feel a strange tingling in the back of your head,
along with it you hear a voice.
"%pcf! Ratcatcher! Quickly come to _mages_. They've been attacked again."

Message:  1146
"%pcf! Did you hear that too? I think it's a psychic
message from _mages_. We should go there straight away.
This is not normal. They only do that kind of thing in
a real crisis!"

Message: 1147
"They came out of no-where. Ran amok. Then they found
your specimen and killed it. It was like an
assassination."

Message: 1148
"Damn! Please tell me you were able to run tests on it
before..."

Message: 1149
"Yes, yes. Thoroughly and more during the attack. These
rats are not magically enhanced. They are just normal,
smelly, vicious, diseased giant rats that are somehow
gathering in warbands and attacking selective groups
across the province."

Message: 1150
"Enough sarcasm. What did you find?!"

Message: 1151
"No sarcasm Ratcatcher. Furthermore these rat attacks
seem to be based around the location of one particular
target. You."

Message:  1167
"What? That's madness."

Message:  1168
"Haven't you noticed? They go where you are. Or where
you are heading. Or where you have been. If there were
rat attacks on this scale all over the province we'd
know about it. You are drawing the rats Ratcatcher.
You and your friend. I know not why, but I would quite
appreciate if you got out of our town and didn't return."

Message: 1152
"What? This is not my doing! I kill rats..."

Message: 1153
"And they hate you for it. Ever think that maybe you've
just killed so many of them that those that remain have
decided to deal with you to save themselves? You are the
one that drones on about how smart they are. Maybe
you've just managed to kill all the stupid ones and
those that are left are the ones sart enough to outsmart
you, Ratcatcher."

Message:  1169
"You... you're talking nonsense _sarcmage_! Rats aren't
that organised. I've hunted the all my life, I'd know
if they were capable of..."

Message:  1170
"Regardless. This is your problem. And yours only.
Please leave. Take your friend and your foul
bag of accoutrements and don't darken our guild or town
again. Goodbye."

Message: 1154
"%pcf... I think I need to stop and think. I do my best
thinking in the tavern. Let's go to the tavern. Please."

Message: 1155
"Ratcatcher!"

Message: 1156
"Yeah, we know your game. Bet he's carrying them in a bag
and releasing them then comes round thinking he can just
waltz in and 'save' us. Get out."

Message: 1157
"Ratcatcher! I think it might be for the best if you and
your friend left town. Don't you? For your own good you
understand. People aren't too happy with you right now.
Can't blame them. You have an hour to leave otherwise
you'll be put in jail for your own good."

Message: 1158
"I didn't... %pcf? You know me. I wouldn't. Ratcatching
is my life. I wouldn't besmirch the name of my craft.
You must believe me!"

Message:  1163
"I don't know what's happening %pcf. We can't even get
a drink in this place anymore. I think we best leave
until thinks die down or I can figure out what is going
on with these rats."
<ce>Leave town?

Message: 1164
"They keep coming %pcf! It is me they want. You should go. Save yourself. They want me dead. Go, save yourself. This is not your fight. It was never your fight. Go!"
<ce>Leave the Ratcatcher to his fate?

Message:  1173
The Ratcatcher fights back tears as you decide to remain
with him until the end, "Thank you %pcf. You are the
truest friend an old Ratcatcher could have. Let's leave
our stains on these bastards memories!"

Message:  1175
"%pcf... This one... this one has something on it.
Can you... can you see what it is?"

Message:  1174
"Goodbye %pcf!" as you run you don't look back as the
Ratcatcher is overrun by his lifelong prey.

Message:  1176
The Ratcatcher says nothing as you show him the note. He
turns away and stares into the distance for some time.

Message:  1177
"%pcf. I... I need to go and figure things out. Alone.
You have been a good friend, but... this is my fight.
And I'm tired. I don't know what do do. I think I need to
leave. Go away. Think. I've... I've lost too much and in
the end I'm just a guy who catches rats. I'm not smart.
This game has become too complex. I can't play anymore."

Message: 1178
"Goodbye %pcf. Maybe we'll meet again. Maybe not. Please
take this. It's all I have worth anything."

Message:  1119
_questgiver_ is still snoring. Occasionally he whimpers
and cries out for someone called _wife_.
<ce>
Probably best give him another few hours.

Message:  1159
"%pcf, can we please get a move-on. Rats breed quickly!"

Message:  1180
A tired looking messenger in blood-spattered
____hamlet_ livery stops you and shoves a letter into
your hand.
<ce>
Questgiver looks over your shoulder, "What does it say
%pcf?"

Message:  1179
"Well, that's that. I'm done for. Thanks %pcf. We
dithered about on your whim and now my reputation is
in tatters. Some buddy you turned out to be. I'll head
east. Try to rebuild my career. If I can at my age.
Hopefully we never see each other again.
<ce>
<ce>And with that, The Ratcatcher General is gone.
Forever.

Message:  1181
An out-of-breath teenage boy of impressive size runs up
to you both, "Ratcatcha'! It's... the... at the
_tav_! They... it's rats! They..." he doubles over
struggling to get his breath.

Message:  1182
"Quickly, %pcf! To _tav_!"

Message:  1183
"What? You want paid for this? I kicked you out of the
tavern and suddenly we are awarmed by rats! You know
what people are saying Ratcatcher? They are saying you
drive the rats in and then charge people to kill them.
All a bit convenient!"

Message:  1184
The Ratcatcher is furious, "HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME OF..."

Message:  1185
"Get out before I call the guards! You fraud!"
<ce>
The Ratcatcher tenses himself up for a fight
you will probably have to finish.
<ce>
<ce>Take him away before this gets out of hand?

Message:  1189
You take _questgiver_ gently by the shoulder and
convince him to walk away from this one.

Message:  1190
With suprising speed for a man of his age the
Ratcatcher hurls himself onto _barkeep_, fists flying.
The man yells for help.

Message:  1186
"Here's the bait. I'll do the nest"

Message: 1187
"Found it %pcf. Hold 'em off while I destroy this thing."

Message: 1188
"It's done. Kill the stragglers then let's see
_barkeep_ for our pay.

Message: 1201

So-called Ratcatcher,
_hamlet_ was overun by rats. We've had to call in warriors at great
expense. Some building have had to be razed. We requested
your services and you failed to arrive in time. If you
are still on your way then I suggest you turn back less
one of the archers shoots you... by accident.
