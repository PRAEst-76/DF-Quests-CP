%t! You seem to be a capable %pct. I need help
badly. It's our boy, %t. He's gone missing. Run
away from home we fear. We need someone to find
him. At least make sure he's ok.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
What should we do. No-one will help us!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Thank you! Thank you %t. His name is _boy_. He's
always been a sensitive child. We were maybe too
hard on him. Thought we could toughen him up. We
didn't think he'd run away. We're so worried. He's
not strong. We don't know where he may have gone
to. He doesn't have many friends. Maybe you could
ask around. See if anyone knows of him.
<ce>
Please hurry! We live at _house_ if you find him.

QuestFail:  [1003]
Our poor boy. He wasn't cut out for this harsh world.
Thank you for trying to bring him home to us.
This will be a bleak winter.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
Thank you! Thank you %t! You don't know how much
this means to us! You have reunited this family again!
We'll take care of him. Support him, in anything he chooses.

Saw a kid in _library_ last week. In my day we played outside.
<--->
Saw a gang of kids push another kid into the river. It think one of them was _baddad_'s boy.

They are good people. Not well off, but good.

Message:  1021
I saw some other kids push him in the fountain once.
<--->
_boy_ is never out of that _library_. Should be out getting up to mischief like normal kids.

Message:  1022
_otherbully_? Yeah. He lives at _obhouse_.
<--->
I see that kid looking at flowers. Not normal.

Message:  1050
_boy_ was here, yeah. He's always here.
He reads a lot. I don't read. I like to look at
the pictures.
He stole a book, don't tell the man. Said he was
going to read it outside but some big kids took
it and threw it away. He's not going to come back
here without the book.
They are at _tav_. Maybe you can go and beat 'em up?
They might know where he went.

Message:  1051
What's your problem %ra?
I know nothing about no _boy_.
<ce>Threaten the brat?

Message:  1052
Ok. Ok. We pushed him around. Took his book.
We threw it in the river. He said he's going to
become a powerful mage and come back and send us
to oblivion. So we threw him in the river.
I think I saw _otherbully_ get the book out
and take it home. Maybe it had naked ladies in it.

Message:  1053
Get lost %ra!

Message:  1054
Oh, _boy_ yeah. _bully_ and the other
kids rough him up sometimes. He reads and stuff.
Said he wanted to be a mage. That didn't help.
_bully_'s dad hates mages. I think they
did stuff to him. He's an angry guy. Drinks a lot.

Message:  1055
Oh. The book. _book_. Yeah. I read a bit.
Don't tell the other kids! I mean, _boy_
is ok, but he's embarrasing. Says stupid stuff.
Look. I like _bully_, but %g's got problems.
His dad is the main one. If you go and beat up
his dad, I'll give you the book. He's a bad man,
you'll be doing everyone a favour.

Message:  1056
What do you want %ra? Got a beef with me?

Message:  1059
Here's the book. He had some notes in it too.
Tell the other kids I burned it. I don't want to
go in the river like _boy_.

Message:  1100
I've been trying to use magic, but
these books aren't useful. I need better ones.
Proper magic ones like they have at mages guilds.
There is a _mages_ in __mages_. I should go there.
Maybe they'll let me join.
