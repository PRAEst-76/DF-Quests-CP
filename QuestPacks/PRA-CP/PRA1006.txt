%hnr! You seem to be a capable %pct. I need help
badly. It's our boy, %hnr. He's gone missing. Run
away from home we fear. We need someone to find
him. At least make sure he's ok.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
What should we do. No-one will help us!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Thank you! Thank you %hnr. His name is _boy_. He's
always been a sensitive child. We were maybe too
hard on him. Thought we could toughen him up. We
didn't think he'd run away. We're so worried. He's
not strong. We don't know where he may have gone
to. He doesn't have many friends. Maybe you could
ask around. See if anyone knows of him.
<ce>
Please hurry! We live at _house_ if you find him.

QuestFail:  [1003]
Our poor boy. He wasn't cut out for this harsh world.
Thank you for trying to bring him home to us.
This will be a bleak winter.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
Thank you! Thank you %hnr! You don't know how much
this means to us! You have reunited this family again!
We'll take care of him. Support him, in anything he chooses.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Lot of kids have gone missing lately. They say the dragons took them. When I say they, I mean the guys at the tavern.
<--->
Saw a kid in _library_ last week. In my day we played outside.
<--->
Saw a gang of kids push another kid into the river. It think one of them was _baddad_'s boy.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Awful what happened to that kid. Some nasty characters about and no mistake.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I heard some creeps were stealing kids, but a %ra done for them. I'd buy that %ra a drink.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Thank you again.

QuestorPostFailure:   [1009]
Please leave us.

-- Rumours
Message:  1020
They are good people. Not well off, but good.

Message:  1021
I saw some other kids push him in the fountain once.
<--->
_boy_ is never out of that _library_. Should be out getting up to mischief like normal kids.

Message:  1022
_otherbully_? Yeah. Lives over at _obhouse_.
<--->
I see that kid looking at flowers. Not normal.
<--->
Hangs around with _bully_. That kid isn't a good infuence.

Message:  1023
_rumfellow_? Yeah, that's a rum one and no mistake. Lives at _rumhouse_ I believe.
<--->
I've seen %g2 around. I don't know where you could find %g2 though, nor why you would want to.

Message:  1024
I saw _rumfellow_ leading some kid to _rumhouse_. Not the first.
<--->
Someone was murdered in _rumhouse_. Some dark types have moved in since. You want to avoid that place.

Message:  1025
A nasty peice of work. His boy, _bully_ isn't much better. Lives in _bullyhouse_.

Message:  1026
Rotten child. _otherbully_ follows him around like a puppy.
<--->
Brat. Smashed my windows last month. Does what he wants because his dad is a thug.

-- Dialogues

Message:  1050
"_boy_ was here, yeah. He's always here.
He reads a lot. I don't read. I like to look at
the pictures.
He stole a book, don't tell the man. Said he was
going to read it outside but some big kids took
it and threw it away. He's not going to come back
here without the book.
They are at _tav_. Maybe you can go and beat 'em up?
They might know where he went."

Message:  1051
"What's your problem %ra?
I know nothing about no _boy_."
<ce>
<ce>Threaten the brat?

Message:  1052
"Ok! Ok! We pushed him around. Took his book.
We threw it in the river. He said he's going to
become a powerful mage and come back and send us
to oblivion. So we threw him in the river.
I think I saw _otherbully_ get the book out and
take it home. Maybe it had naked ladies in it."

Message:  1053
"Get lost %ra!"

Message:  1054
"Oh, _boy_ yeah. _bully_ and the other
kids rough him up sometimes. He reads and stuff.
Said he wanted to be a mage. That didn't help.
_bully_'s dad hates mages. I think they
did stuff to him. He's an angry guy. Drinks a lot."

Message:  1055
"Oh. The book. _book_. Yeah. I read a bit.
Don't tell the other kids! I mean, _boy_
is ok, but he's embarrasing. Says stupid stuff.
Look. I like _bully_, but %g's got problems.
His dad is the main one. If you go and beat up
his dad, _baddad_, I'll give you the book.
He's a bad man, you'll be doing everyone a favour."

Message:  1056
"What do you want %ra? Got a beef with me?"

Message:  1057
"You're going to regret walking in here %ra!"

Message:  1058
"Then why are you in my ruddy home %ra?!"

Message:  1059
"Ok! Stop hitting me. I know when I'm beat.
I'm outta here. You won't see me around again.
Don't kill me %ra!"

Message:  1060
"You did it? That's wonderful! Did you make him cry?
You didn't kill him did you? I hope not. That's
going a bit far, but I'm sure someone would anyway.
He's a really bad guy."

Message:  1061
"Here's the book. The kid had some notes in it too.
Tell the other kids I burned it. I don't want to
go in the river like _boy_."

Message:  1068
"That kid? Came here wanting to learn to be a sorceror.
Pah. The amount of kids that just flaunce in here thinking
we'll drop everything to bestown upon them the art!
Asked him to show me a cantrip. Anything! Kid has no
latent talent. I told him. 'You have no latent talent,
kid. Come back when you have some vestage of mystic skill!'
Ran off weeping. I bet we never see him again. We never
do."

Message:  1069
"No. I've no idea where he went. Nor do I care. We
are a Mages Guild, not an orphanage!"

Message:  1062
A small girl runs up to you.
<ce>
"Hey %hnr! You looking for that kid that was here?
He ran out of _mages_ a few days ago. Crying, he was.
I followed him but he saw me and yelled. I saw him go
into the alley behind _store_. Maybe go and see if
they saw him there."

Message:  1063
"You are looking for that kid who was hiding out back?
Felt a bit sorry for him. Think he might have been
an orphan. Was crying. Tried to give him some food
but he left. Saw him talking to _rumfellow_. You
might want to ask %g2. I'm not sure where %g lives though."

Message:  1064
"Can I help you friend?"

Message: 1065
"_boy_? No. I've not heard of him."

Message:  1066
"Of course, we don't really pay attention to their
names. The names aren't important. Their youth is.
Sadly you aren't young enough for our needs, but
I'm sure we can make some use out of your parts."

Message:  1067
"What's this? Some do-gooder come for the kid?
You have no idea who you are dealing with %ra!
We have powerful friends. People who could
crush you with a word. I'd tell you to turn around
and forget you saw us, but we'll just cut you
up instead."

Message:  1075
"You are here to take me home to my parents?
I'm so scared. They were going to cut me into
pieces. Take me home! I don't want to be a mage
anymore. Mages are scary."

-- Corrispondance
Message:  1100
I bin trying to use magicks, but these books aren't
useful. They dont say how I ackually do magic!
I need better ones. Proper magic ones.
like they have at mages guilds.
There is a mages guild in __mages_.
I should go there.
Maybe they'll let me join them.

-- Notifications
Message: 1150
That's the bully's dad dealt with. Now to go back
and tell _otherbully_.

Message:  1151
This seems to be a map to ___rumdun_.
Maybe that's where they take the kids?

Message: 1155
It's unlikely I'll find _boy_ alive at this point.

-- Logs
Message:  1200
%qdt:
I've been hired to find a missing child called
_boy_ who has apparently run away from home.
His parents don't know where he has gone so I need
to ask around. When I find him I need to bring him
back to _house_. Realistically if I don't find
him within =kiddemise_ days, I'll never find him.

Message:  1201
%qdt:
A kid in the library said _boy_ comes there a lot.
Some other kids were pushing him around last time
he was there and threw his book away.
They hang out at _tav_.
I should go speak to them.

Message:  1202
%qdt:
I got the bully to tell me what he did. _boy_ said
he was going to become a mage and get revenge.
Another kid called _otherbully_ took the book.
I should find out where %g lives.

Message:  1203
%qdt:
_otherbully_ will give me the book if I beat
up _bully_'s dad, _baddad_.

Message:  1204
%qdt:
_baddad_ has been dealt with. I should get
the book from _otherbully_ at _obhouse_.

Message:  1205
%qdt:
I got the book from _otherbully_. It's just a
copy of _book_,
however there was a note inside. The note said
_boy_ was planning to go to _mages_
to become a powerful mage.

Message:  1206
%qdt:
The mages gave him the cold shoulder. Another kid
said he hid in the alley behind _store_.
I should go there and see if anyone's seen him.

Message:  1207
%qdt:
A customer told me the kid was seen with someone
called _rumfellow_.

Message:  1208
%qdt:
_rumfellow_ apparently lives at _rumhouse_.

Message:  1209
%qdt:
At _rumhouse_ some dark types tried to kill me.
Seems like they are doing something awful with
the missing kids.

Message:  1210
%qdt:
They had a map to a place called ___rumdun_.
Perhaps they took the kids there?

Message:  1211
%qdt:
I've found _boy_. I should get him back to his parents at _house_ in __house_.
