%t! You seem to be a capable %pct. I need help
badly. It's our boy, %t. He's gone missing. Run
away from home we fear. We need someone to find
him. At least make sure he's ok.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
What should we do. No-one will help us!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Thank you! Thank you %t. His name is _boy_. He's
always been a sensitive child. We were maybe too
hard on him. Thought we could toughen him up. We
didn't think he'd run away. We're so worried. He's
not strong. We don't know where he may have gone
to. He doesn't have many friends. Maybe you could
ask around. See if anyone knows of him.
<ce>
Please hurry!

Our poor boy. He wasn't cut out for this harsh world.
Thank you for trying to bring him home to us.
This will be a bleak winter.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
Thank you! Thank you %t! You don't know how much
this means to us! You have reunited this family again!
We'll take care of him. Support him, in anything he chooses.
