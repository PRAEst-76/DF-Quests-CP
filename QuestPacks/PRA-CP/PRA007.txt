As you hear the accusation, you wonder if perhaps you did steal %g3 gem. However you have no recollection of doing so.

_questgiver_ has just run out the door screaming.

You notice a patron sigh and approach you.

What did you say to _questgiver_?
Yoou know what? It doesn't matter. He was doing

again.
<ce>
Well, go on. Go and find him before he hurts
himself or gets lost in a dungeon, again.
