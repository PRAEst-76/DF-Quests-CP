QuestorOffer:  [1000]
"I don't need anything doing, but I know a lady in
a sad situation that is looking for someone to
help her with a family affair, if you are
interested in that sort of thing?"
<ce>
"Probably won't involve fighting orcs or slaying
dragons, but I think she is a moneyed dame, if
that's your draw? Might drop you a few coins if
you help her out."

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
"No skin off my nose. Some people just aren't into
helping those in need, I figure."

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
"Well, her name is _lady_ and you'll
find her at _ladyhome_."
<ce>
"Hopefully you can do something for the poor lass.
She should be there for another week or so."

QuestFail:  [1003]
_lady_ will have left _ladyhome_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
They are both at rest now together. Their troubles are over.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I hear _lady_'s got some family troubles.
<--->
Heard about the tragedy at __farm_? That poor girl.
<--->
Heard about the tragedy at __farm_? That poor man.
<--->
Just awful what happened to _widower_'s wife? I blame the parents.
<--->
Did you hear _lady_'s daughter killed herself. Probably money. It's always money.

-- More rumours

Message: 1010
Be wary of that one. Acts all high and mighty, but I've seen her in some low places.
<--->
She's always well turned out, even when she's in the shadows.

Message: 1011
I heard he was kicked out of the Mages Guild for bad practice.
<--->
Noisy skeltons in that closet. That's all I'm saying.

Message: 1012
A good lass I hear. Very loyal. Not sure to who though.
<--->
Works on that farm. I think, though I see her around a lot. Not sure what she does there.
<--->
She has a soft spot for yer fella. I guess the way is open now.

Message: 1013
A sad tale that one. There was always a darkness in her eyes that the beautiful smile couldn't really hide.
<--->
I heard about what happened. Suspicious, if you ask me. It's her bloke I feel sorry for.
<--->
Why would a girl like that do such a thing? I guess we never really know a person.

Message: 1014
Salt of the earth. Worked all his life. Sad what happened. Really sad.
<--->
A good man. I hear he's not taking the death of his wife well. Horrible thing.

Message:  1020
"Oh hello! Sorry, you startled me. I was lost in
my thoughts..."
<ce>
"You have come to help? I'm not sure what you can
do. I'm not sure what anyone can do now. We've
lost our only child. Our beautiful _daughter_."

Message:  1021
"You see, she was wed to a man, not of good stock,
but a good man nonetheless. Built that farm with
his own hands. Tried to give her a good life...
but a few weeks past... she took her own life.
We do not know why. She was happy and loved by
all that knew her."

Message:  1022
"Now he lies there in his rooms, unwilling to eat
or speak to anyone. The farm is going to seed
without his care; the hands are leaving, unable
or unwilling to see him waste away from his
heartbreak!"
<ce>
"The maid came to me in tears, not knowing what to
do. He will not speak to me or the girls father."

Message:  1023
"I am desperate dear %pcf! Can you go to there
and see if you can speak to him and rouse him
from his grief?"

Message:  1024
"Thank you %pcf. That is all I ask. Perhaps such
as you can make him see some glimmer of light!"
<ce>
"Please now, go to __farm_ and try to
stir him out of his darkness. Here is some gold
to cover your expenses."

Message:  1025
You are stopped outside the farm by a servant,
"I'm sorry %hnr. The master is not seeing
any guests at this time."
<ce>
"He is... unwell."

Message: 1029
The maid takes you by the arm, "Please, %hnr!"
<ce>
"If you look around you will see this farm is
dying as our master dies. As his lady died. It
grieves, you see."
<ce>
"The workers are leaving. Many have not been paid
this month. The land he worked so hard for is
turning to dust and all the money has gone."

Message:  1030
"However _daughter_'s father sent word that
he also equally grieves the loss of his daugher,
however he says he can help us."
<ce>
"Our master won't hear from him, but perhaps you
can talk to him? Tell him how things
are here. How broken our master is..."

Message:  1031
"Thank you! Thank you!"
<ce>
"Please. Go now. Speak to him at his quarters at
__dadhome_."
<ce>
"See if he can help us. I know he is a man of
considerable wealth and power."
<ce>
"Please do this! Help end this curse of despair on
this land!"

Message:  1032
"Then leave me, %ra. Leave me to my grief."

Message: 1034
"Please %god. Will no one help us!"
<ce>
"Take your iron heart from these darkned lands
less you make them darker with your presence!"

Message:  1049
The man looks tired and obviously has not slept,
"I have performed the first part of the ritual.
Her heart was the most important aspect of her. I
have removed and prepared it for rebirth into her
new form. The ritual needs to be performed
within a week at my remote laboratory. We should
take the heart and the necessary equipment and
make for ___lab_ without delay."

Message:  1050
"This is it. This is the place."
<ce>
"Deep within there is an stone that needs to be
cleansed and prepared. However to get there we will
probably face enemies. Harden yourself. We are almost
there. My daughter will live once more."

Message:  1051
"This is the stone %pcf. I shall prepare the
ritual. Keep guard on your guard, for we are
not safe in this place."

Message:  1052
"Stop! Stop what you are doing with our
little girl?! This is madness! She is dead.
She cannot return."

Message:  1053
"_lady_! You followed us here?! I can return her!
I know how. We can have our daughter back with us.
Back with her husband. He is lost without her!"

Message:  1054
"Her husband is dead! His grief destroyed him. His
farm is lost. We've all lost. Let us not lose our
minds and souls as well."

Message:  1055
"No. He let his grief consume him. I am stronger.
I have the power to return her to us. I will not
let you stop me."

Message:  1056
"You stupid old goat! I always said your lust for
control would destroy you in the end.
Men! End him and retrive my daughters remains!"

Message:  1057
"Curse you _lady_! %pcf! To my aid!"

Message:  1058
"She is dead. _lady_ is dead. I knew it would end
like this, but I can still have my daughter."
<ce>
"Guard me while I continue the ritual! I can't
afford any more interruptions. Precision is
vital!"

Message:  1059
"She is waking... She is with us again! My
beautiful daughter."
<ce>
"Daughter? Can you hear me? It is me,
your father?"
<ce>
"Daughter?"

Message:  1060
"Oh no. %pcn! This cannot be. The ritual was
correct!"
<ce>
"My child?"
<ce>
"No! Stop! %pcf! She is an abomination!
End this, please!"

Message:  1061
"Noooooo..!"

Message:  1062
"Then you will also fall! Men, kill the %pct!"

Message:  1063
"Curse you %pcf. I knew you would not have the
stomach for this. Like many of your kind before
you, you will lie with my witch of
a wife, but in a burial pit."

Message:  1064
"Well done all. I shall return my daughter to her
slumber in the family tomb. That monster can lie here
in the tomb of his own making."
<ce>
"There is but one more task to do here. Men, you
know your orders..."

Message:  1065
"They... they are dead. Both... both of my parents
are dead. I am... finally free. The only... way I
could... escape... thank you %pcf."

Message:  1066
"Please... one more... task. Just one more...
Return me to my love. He lies... in ___othergrave_
I wish... us to be alone together... as we could
not be... in life."
<ce>
"Return my heart to my beloved.
In... ___othergrave_.
Please %pcf!"

Message: 1067
<ce>I have left _daughter_'s remains with those of
<ce>her husband. I hope they find peace here.

%qdt:
I've been sent to visit _lady_
at _ladyhome_ in __ladyhome_
who has family issues.

Message:  1101
%qdt:
_lady_ of ____lady_ has told me the
sad story of her daughter and sent me to
__farm_ to try to talk some sense to her
son-in-law who has fallen into grief.

Message:  1103
%qdt:
The maid at ___farm_ told me to see
_daughter_'s father in __dadhome_
who may be able to help.

Message: 1108
%qdt:
The girls father wants us to take _daughter_'s
remains to ___lab_.
<ce>
He plans to bring his daughter back from the dead
somehow.

Message: 1109
%qdt:
He is getting impatient to ___lab_.
I should make haste.

Message: 1110
%qdt:
We are at ___lab_. Now to find this altar
so _daughter_'s father can perform the ritual
to raise his daughter.

Message: 1111
%qdt:
Both parents are dead, as is _widower_. However
_daughter_'s ghost has appeared and told me to
take her remains to those of her husband in
__othergrave_ so they can be together.

Message: 1151
A page stops you and hands you a letter with a
noble seal. He does not make eye contact or await
a gratuity.

Message: 1153
Why do we delay?! Time is of the essence in our
task, %pcf!
I must have my daugher back with us.
We must go to the _lab_!
Now!

Message: 1154
Enough! I can no longer tolerate your cowardly
procrastinations, %pcf. If do not posess the
stomach for this then you shall die for wasting
my time and risking my daughter!

Message: 1201
Dear %pcf
                                %qdat
I have just received word that _widower_ has died.
His heart could no longer take his grief it seems.
The maid said you had not been there. Why did you
not visit him as I asked?!
Maybe there was nothing you could do, but you 
said you would try.
We are now filled with double the sorrow, and his
lands they worked so hard to tame have gone to
seed.
Please do not respond, as I don't really have the
stomach for your excuses.
                            _lady_
                            ____lady_

Message: 1202
Dear %pcf
                                %qdat
I am the maid at __farm_. I am writing
with the sad news that our dear lost employer
_widower_ succumed to his grief. I can only
assume that your trip to see his father-in-law
was unsuccessful.
The few of us that are left are packing our
things to leave as the Bank of %reg
has reclaimed the lands and asked us to depart
immediately. I shall be traveling back to my
village, however some here have no place to go.
I hope they will be ok. I'm sure you tried your
hardest to convince the father to help.
So I do not blame you in this.
I wish you good health in your travels.
                        Yours faithfully,
                        %fn
                        (former) Maid of __farm_
