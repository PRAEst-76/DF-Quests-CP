<ce>Looks like _questgiver_'s career in Ratcatching is over.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>Is this the end for The Ratcatcher General?

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Heard that dodgy ratcatcher is in town. I thought they'd driven him out of ____library_ after they found out what he was doing?
<--->
I can't believe that ratcatcher was a crook. He seemed like such a nice guy.

Message:  1010
His home is the road he says. I hear it's 'cause his wife kicked him out 'cause he smells like rodent.
<--->
My brother says he releases the rats first then comes round to 'catch' 'em and charge folk.
<--->
If you don't pay him he takes your kids. Someone told me.
<--->
He's decent enough, bit rough around the edges.

Message:  1011
Owns _tav_ but doesn't run it. Just counts the money.
<--->
The ladies seem to be fond of him. Can't think why. Other than his gold.
<--->
I've heard he's got a collection of trophies from his conquests. Some say he just steals them from washing lines at night.

Message:  1012
You don't want to talk to that one. The Dark Brotherhood would kill for a knife as sharp as his tongue.
<--->
He smells like an old woman who fell in a rosebush.
<--->
Another one of those frock wearing freaks up at the horror farm. That's what my dad calls it.
<--->
Always got his nose in a book that one. I don't think he's reading them, he just likes to sniff the pages.
<--->
Was icy a few years back and me and some lads saw him slip and fall on his arse. We laughed so hard, but the look he gave us haunts me to this day.

Message:  1013
Nice girl. Haven't seen her or her mum around for a long time though.
<--->
Oh. She used to help the old Ratcatcher out. May have been his kid. Haven't seen her in a long time, now I think of it. Hope she wasn't eaten.
<--->
I remember her. Smart girl. I guess she went off to better things.

Message:  1014
Oh. The old Ratcatcher's wife. I think she left him for a wealthy man from abroad.
<--->
That snooty cow. Had airs, but we all rmemember she married a man who caught rats. And she knew it.
