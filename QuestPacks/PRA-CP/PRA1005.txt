QuestorOffer:  [1000]
I've got a task for a worthy adventurer should
that be you. My family keep has been taken by
undead. I  mean to go there and take it back.

RefuseQuest:   [1001]
Hmph. Another coward. Well go on then. I'm sure
someone has rats for you to kill.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Good. I was wondering when someone would show some
guts. We need to make for _keep_
in ___keep_ straight away. Slay the undead filth
living therein and reclaim it for my family.

_questgiver_ has employed me to take him to his
family keep, ___keep_ and slay the
undead there so he can reclaim it. He says we
need to do this within =coward_ days.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
In a surprising turn of events, the _lich_ in
___crypt_ is _questgiver_'s brother
_brother_. They now both want me to help
them to seek out their father to end the dispute.
We need to do this within =coward2_ days.

Message:  1100
Ok %pcn. We are here. Watch the shadows.
This place is garded by mercenaries, but there is
a powerful _lich_ here. It leads them through the
power of it's will. We must slay it quickly.

Message:  1101
There %pcn! There is the _lich_. Quickly. End it!

Message:  1102
Foolish mortals. You dare intrude on the domain of...
<ce>
_questgiver_? What are you doing here?

Message:  1103
Now %pcf! Ignore it's pratter! Less it dominate you!

Message:  1104
What are you doing _questgiver_? Who is this %ra?
What are you doing in my keep?

Message:  1105
This is not your keep brother! It's mine.
I intend to take it back! %pcn is my arm!

Message:  1106
Father left it to me when he died! It's mine by
right, as the eldest! You are nothing but a thief!

Message:  1107
He left it to you, but when you died it passed
to me. That is the law!

Message:  1108
I'm still here you welk! This is still
my keep!

Message:  1109
You are dead! You're a walking corpse! Legally
you can't own anything!
<ce>
Kill him %pcf!

Message:  1110
Stay your hand %pcf! This is my keep and
my cretinous little brother has lead you here on
false pretences to claim what was never his by right.
Our father left it to me. I was the favoured son.
<ce>
<ce>Kill the lich?

Message:  1111
No. Father loved me best. He always said so.
He'd be horrified to see what you've become!

Message:  1112
Well then, why don't we ask him?

Message:  1113
What? We can't. He's dead.

Message:  1114
As you were at pains to point out, so am I, and
yet here you are talking to me.
<ce>
His ghost haunts ___crypt_. We go there.
We ask him who get's the keep. If he says it's
yours then I'll leave and take my people with me.

Message:  1115
Your 'people'? This rabble of monsters and thugs?
This ridiculous %pcf! Cut this scarecrow down and
we can put our feet up.

Message:  1116
Always the coward brother!
Too cowardly to come here alone. To cowardly to
face the possibility father didn't love you like
he loved me..!

Message:  1117
Shut your stupid bony face!
<ce>
%pcf!
<ce>
<ce>Kill _brother_ the _lich_?

Message:  1118
Let us go. Truce until we learn the truth?

Message:  1119
Fine, but you will be the one crying to mother.

Message:  1120
Mother is dead, but fine.
<ce>
%pcf. We head for ___crypt_.
Let my brother learn the truth, as harsh as it
may be, then you can take him back to whatever
hovel you found him in.

Message:  1121
Who dares disturb the resting place of...

Message:  1122
Father! It's us!

Message:  1123
Oh %god! Don't I get a moments peace even in death
from you two breech-stains!?

Message:  1124
The family keep, father. Who gets it? Me or
_brother_?

Message:  1125
You left it to me! _questgiver_ has been
nothing but a dissapointment to you, you told me
yourself...

Message:  1126
That's it? That's why you are here? That bloody
shambles. I hated that place. I left
it to rack and ruin. It belongs to the earth it
soiled, and that's where it should go!

Message:  1127
Who father! Which one of us gets it?

Message:  1128
I don't care! I just want to be left alone!
Ask your mother. It was hers to begin with.
Now please leave me be!

Message:  1129
What? Mother is dead!

Message:  1130
No she isn't, you stupid fungal growths!
I'll call her. She can deal with you two.

_mother_!

Message:  1131
Who summons me?

Message:  1132
We do. Your sons. Father says you own _keep_?
Which one of us gets it when you die?

Message:  1133
I don't care for your mortal squabbles!
Both of you will be dead by then.

Message:  1134
Actually, I'm not mortal anymore?

Message:  1135
I care not! Begone before I destroy you all!
I despise the pair of you. I should have
strangled you both at birth!

Message:  1136
<ce>Slip away?

Message:  1137
Where are you going?

Message: 1138
One us has to have it. You have to choose!

Message:  1139
I choose what I should have chosen long ago.
To destroy you both! And your gullible friend too!

Message:  1140
Mummy! Please!

Message:  1141
This is your fault!

Message:  1150
My brother is dead. _keep_ is mine now.
Let's head back to __questgiver_
so I can arrange some men to come and fix the
place up a bit... and perhaps see if these
tapestries can be repaired.

Message:  1151
Well done %pcf. Here. Have this. You've earned it.

Message:  1180
I can assume we aren't going to clear
___crypt_? Useless %ra! I don't need you.

Message:  1181
%ra! You have dithered too much. We will go alone.
You will rot here!
