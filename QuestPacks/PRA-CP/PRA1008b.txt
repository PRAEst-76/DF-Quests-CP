A famous book collector lives in _nobhome_. Not that I've ever heard of him.
<--->
I don't read books myself. Rots the brain.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I hear they ran a thief out of town in __nobhome_. Tried to steal a book collection.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Someone robbed the book collector in __nobhome_. Stole everything. Including the collector.

Message:  1018
Now to find that collector. You should ask around.

Message:  1019
You've left it too long to speak to your 'friend'.
They will have left __thief_ by now.

Message:  1020
A small man approaches you. He appears to be some
sort of servant
<ce>
"Excuse me, but _nob_ is not receiving
guests right now. I'm afraid you will have to leave."

Message:  1021
"_akagrathtome_? His book collection is not for perusal.
This is not a library! Please leave or I will be forced
to summon the guards."

Message:  1022
"I warned you!"

Message:  1023
A message is stuffed into your hand. You don't see how.

Message:  1024
"I know what you are after. _nob_ has
a book you want. He also has a book I want. My
methods of retrival are less direct and usually a
lot more effective."

Message:  1025
"He has a sister at __sister_ in
___sister_. _sister_ is her name.
A sickly lady by all accounts. She gets a delivery of
food every week. I can arrange for a delivery to be
delayed. You will then make the delivery."

Message:  1026
"I see your face. Yes, it will be poisoned, but no it
will not be fatal. It'll just make her a ill for a time.
Brother will then come running to take care of her and
while he's away you can loot his gaff and get what we
both need."

Message:  1027
"Return to the tavern at __nobhome_ and wait there.
I will send someone with a delivery for you once we
are ready."

Message:  1028
A young boy greets you and hands over a large sack.

Message:  1044
You open the sack, it contains a smaller sack, some
clothes and some letters.

Message:  1029
"Oh, hello. You are early this week. Are you new?
What happened to the last boy? Oh don't tell me.
You probably can't anyway. I know they have staffing
problems with these young ones. It's the same everywhere.
They don't want to work, that's the problem."

Message:  1030
"Thanks very much. Here's a little tip for being early."

Message:  1031
"Tell me though, are _farm_ planning to start including
the little recipie booklets like the other place? It's
getting quite popular. They want to keep up with the 
competition. Not that I'm thinking of switching. I've
heard the other place had some contamination issues.
Your produce is always so fresh."

Message:  1032
"Anyway. I won't keep you. I'm sure you have many other
deliveries to do."

Message:  1033
It seems _thief_ is after the same book you are.
This will complicate matters.

Message:  1034
Just as you pick up the book a _adventurer_ bursts
through the door. Apparently surprised to see you
here, %g draws %g3 sword.

Message:  1035
"I just want the book. _akagrathtome_. Hand it over and
I won't kill you were you stand."
<ce>
Give %g2 the book?

Message:  1036
"Slide it over. Slowly. That's a good %ra. Now...
Unfortunately I can't actually let you live. This is
too important to have you coming for it later.
Nothing personal."

Message:  1037
"Then I'll take it from your corpse!"

Message:  1038
"Ah. You returned. Welcome back %pct.
You have the book I assume?
May I have it?"
<ce>
Hand over _akagrathtome_ to _thief_?

Message:  1039
"Well. Thank you."

Message:  1040
"You surprised me by returning. I didn't think you would.
I admit I'm tempted to ask you to join us, but alas I'm
not convinced you are smart enough."

Message: 1041
"Please. Don't feel bad about this. We played you.
That's all. You were a tool. However, you have outlived
your usefulness and are no longer required."

Message:  1042
"Interesting. You would come all this way, with the
book I so badly desire, and not hand it over. Why?
Ah, because you want it yourself and want to take out
the competition. Almost smart. Almost."

Message:  1043
"This is not over %pct!"
_thief_ has dissapeared. In his haste, he
appears to have dropped the book however.

Message:  1045
You've left it too long to get the book.
_nob_ will have returned and be suspicious.

Message:  1046
"Hey %ra. You got the book? We better go see the boss in
__thief_ straight away. You coming?"

Message:  1047
"Right, let's go chief. You know the way to ___thief_."

Message:  1048
"This isn't the way to ___thief_?! What are you trying to pull? I'll take that book back myself %ra!"

-- Rumours
Message: 1080
_nob_ collects books apparently. What a freak.
<--->
Always has angry people coming and going.
<--->
I've never seen the guy personally. I hear he's a collector of sorts.

Message:  1081
She's heart-fear'd of dirt that one. Heart-fear'd.
<--->
All alone since her family died of plague. Poor woman went a bit funny.

Message:  1082
Who?
<--->
Never heard of %g2.

Message:  1083
%mn used to live in _nobhome_, but he died. Apparently a collector lives there now. I've never seen him.
<--->
Some book collector lives there now. Don't know him. Probably prefers books to people.
<--->
Never seen the new owner, but he gets a lot of guests.

%qdt:
In __nobhome_ I have received a mysterious letter
from 'a friend' asking me to meet with them at
__thief_ in ___thief_ within =friend_ days.

Message:  1101
%qdt:
My 'friend', _thief_ says %g can help me get
the book from _nobhome_. They plan for me
to make a fake food delivery to _nob_'s sister
that will make her ill, but not fatally, and while
the collector is distracted I am to steal the tome
and whatever book _thief_ requires.
<ce>
Right now %g want me to return to the tavern at
__nobhome_ and await a delivery.

Message:  1102
%qdt:
I've received the delivery with instructions along
with a uniform and the _foodparcel_. I'm supposed to
wear the uniform and deliver the parcel to
_sister_ at __sister_ in ___sister_
within =deltime_ days.

Message:  1103
%qdt:
I've delivered the food parcel to _sister_.
Now to go back to the tavern at ___nobhome_
and await further instructions.

Message:  1104
%qdt:
I received my further instructions. Matters have become
more complex. It seems my 'friend' _thief_
is also after _akagrathtome_.
<ce>
I can either steal it and give it to him and possibly
set in motion the very situation I'm attempting to
prevent, or keep it for myself and scarper as soon as
I'm done. Regardless _nob_ will only be away
for a few days so I need to do it soon.

Message:  1105
%qdt:
I've retrieved the book. Wasn't as straightforward as I
was lead to believe. Now to choose who to deliver it to.

Message:  1200
%pct.
<ce>
Come to __thief_ in ___thief_.
I have a proposition for you.
I will only be there for =friend_ days.
<ce>
                                A friend.

Message:  1201
%pct,
<ce>
Find enclosed the uniform of the delivery boy along
with the specially prepared =foodparcel_. Wear the
uniform and take the =foodparcel_ to __sister_
in ___sister_ and deliver it to _sister_
within =deltime_ days.
<ce>
Be professional.
<ce>
Then go back to the tavern, dump the uniform and
await further instructions.
<ce>
                                Your friend.

Well. You faffed that up, and it's all on you.
Have fun.
<ce>
                                Your (former) friend.

Message:  1204
%pct,
<ce>
Excellent work. I hear _sister_ is quite poorly.
Don't worry, ___farm_ will get the blame.
_nob_ will spend the night at his sister's
bedside. You should then be able to sneak into his
home with no real problems.
<ce>
Once there you can take whatever you wish. We are only
interested in one book. It's a rare and ancient book
known as _akagrathtome_. Once you have it, bring it
back to me at __thief_ within =final_ days.
<ce>
You will be well rewarded.
<ce>
                                Your good friend.
