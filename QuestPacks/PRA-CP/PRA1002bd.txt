%fn has been spending a lot of time around __questgiver_

I hear the owner of __questgiver_ has been sampling more than the beer in his cellar.

The Ratcatcher has run up a nasty tab at the inn.
_questgiver_ says he'll clear the debt if I do a
favour for him. I need to take some lady's
'garments' to _othertav_ and leave them in a
back room. This needs to be done within =toolate_ day.

Message:  1163
_questgiver_ gets uncomfortably close and drops
his voice to a hoarse whisper, "Ok. Here's what I
need you to do; I've got here a _evidence_. I want
you to take it and drop it in the back room of
_othertav_ before this time tomorrow."
<ce>
He coughs and his voice returns to normal, "Simple.
Like I said. No risk. Then you get his gear."

Message:  1164
He realises you seem skeptical, "Ok. Ok. So there's
a little bit of skullduggery going on here. The
_evidence_ belongs to a lady I... am aquanted with,
if you get my meaning. When her husband finds them
there, and he will... he's going to think the
proprietor is doing his missus. He'll be livid with
him!"

Message:  1165
<ce>Ok. This is the place. Now to drop the _evidence_
<ce>in one of the back rooms.

Message:  1166
<ce>Ok. That's the... items, left where you were asked.
<ce>Time to go back to _questgiver_.
