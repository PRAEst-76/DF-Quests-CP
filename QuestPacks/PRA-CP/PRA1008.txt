RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I've never heard of a Kagrath, but they sound scary. I hope there is none around here.
<--->
%mn's son went off to save the world. Never seen again. Adventuring is a mugs game.

%fn's boy says the end of the world is coming. Kid was never right after his trip abroad.

I hear the Kagrathi are soon going to attack and kill us all. Another week another apocalypse.

Message:  1015
"Tell me, have you read _bookofkagrath_? Do you know
the terrible bloody history of these ancient peoples?"

Message:  1016
"Hmm. The history is not well known. Only few scolars
have bothered to research it and it is not oft
found in libraries. I hope you do not mind if I test
your knowledge?"
<ce>
"Tell me if the following is true or false. Ahem..." 

Message:  1017
"The Chosen came from the east"

Message: 1018
"The Aldmeri drove the Kagrath into the sea."

Message:  1019
"The Chosen's name was %mn"

Message: 1020
He sighs and holds out an tatty-looking book to you,
"This ancient book, _bookofkagrath_ will explain.
It is important to read it, and know their history.
Once you have updated your knowledge on these peoples
return and speak to me. If you do not return within a
day I will assume you are not up to the task."

Message:  1021
"So now you know the history, you should know that a
daedric cult has apparently found the resting place
of the first of these Kagrath kings, =king1_, and
they plan to raise him. We've no idea if they actually
have the power to do this, however we cannot take the
risk. They are fools and know not the evil they would
unleash upon these lands!"

Message:  1022
"They must be stopped. Go to _tav_ in
__tav_ and find one of their number, they
are known to frequent there, they will have a map
to the grave. Get it from them by whatever means you
deem fit. You must return within =darkness_ days."

Message:  1042
You have taken too long to stop the return of the Kagrath.
Darkness will surely consume these lands.

Message:  1023
You notice this person appears on edge once you
approach, "What do you want %ra? Don't you see
I'm busy?"

Message:  1024
"You want what? I don't know anything about no Keg-ratty!
I'm just here waiting for my friends. I'm not telling
you nothing! Now get lost!"
<ce>
<ce>_mapguy_ isn't going to just hand it over.
<ce>Beat it out of %g2?

Message:  1025
"Ok, ok! Look. I got to live. These people... if they
knew... Look. I just want to get out of this ok. Go back
to my family. I can sell you the map for =mapmoney_ septims.
Then I can make a clean break! Move far away!"
<ce>
<ce>Buy the map?

Message:  1026
"Look. I really need the money. It's for my family, you see.
A better life for myself and my kids. If you can't pay me
for the map you'll have to kill me for it and take it
from my corpse! But... but, there's another way...
This way you get the map and I get enough coin to start
a new life. Deal?"

Message:  1027
"No, wait! It's not supposed to go this way!"

Message:  1043
"Here's your map, nice doing business with you %pcf."

Message:  1028
The map shows the way to ___grave_.
That'll be where they are planning to raise this dead
ancient king.
<ce>
Looks like the map was made on the back of another
map. You should probably look at it again.

Message:  1029
You are at the purported grave of =king1_, one of
the Kagrath kings..

Message:  1030
You spot a couple of shady looking people ahead.
They also manage to spot you.
<ce>
"Someone is coming! Quickly! Complete the ritual!"

Message:  1031
The other waves %g3 hands over the corpse.
"Nyar shthan, Nyar gashanna!"

Message:  1032
The corpse glows with a blue light and shudders,
It rises to it's feet and shambles towards you.
<ce>
"You are too late, %ra! =king1_ is risen!"

Message:  1033
Looks like you've killed the unkillable, and the
cultists have done a runner. Maybe it's time to go
back and tell _questgiver_?

Message:  1034
"You return. Please tell me you were successful in
tracking down the resting place of =king1_ and
preventing his ressurection?"

Message:  1035
_questgiver_ looks astonished.
<ce>
"Wh... what? You killed him? This cannot be. No. Are
you certain he was dead? The cultists fled? This...
I cannot..."

Message:  1036
"I must think. I must study the prophcied texts! Please
Give me a day. Come back tomorrow. I... I will speak to
you then. Here. Please. This is... profound. Tomorrow."

Message: 1037
"You have returned. Ah. I have great news. It appears we
have been blessed. In the darkest of hours. We have been
blessed!"
<ce>
"YOU were able to slay =king1_ only because you are
the chosen!"

Message:  1038
"The divines have placed you here with their power to
drive back the undead Kagrath hordes for good! You must
find their remaining resting places and destroy them
forever."

Message: 1039
"To do this, we must know where the rest were buried.
This is not something commonly known, however it was
belived that some Kagrathi gathered up the remains of
their fallen kings and interred them in a hidden tomb
before they fled these lands."

Message:  1040
"Rumour has it that they kept a journal, handed down
in secret though the generations since those days. I
have never seen it, though I've searched for many years,
however I have learned that it may still exist in the
private collection of an arrogant ____noblehome_
noble. If they have the book then we must retrieve it,
by any means necessary."

Message:  1041
"You must go now, to the home of the collector in
___noblehome_ and retrieve that book, if it exists.
It is our only chance to slay them before they
raise an army to once again cover these lands in
darkness!"

Message:  1044
"Ah. You have it. Please. Let me see!"

Message:  1045
"I was doubtful it even existed, but this looks authetic.
%oth. To hold this.... look. My hands are
shaking. Have you read it? It is in the ancient Kagrath
tongue. It will take time to translate, time we cannot
really afford but we have no choice. I will take it to
an associate of mine."

Message:  1046
"I will send you a message when we are ready to proceed.
If you see the darkness approaching then know we are too
late. I pray that this will not be the case so will make
haste. Be ready for my return %pcf!"

Message:  1047
"I am glad to see you my friend. We are closer than ever.
Here is the translation. To summarise; the Kagrathi kings
are interred beneath ___tomb_."
<ce>
"Pray we are not too late. Perhaps you can reach it before
they are raised. If not, you will have a fight on your
hands, but I am confident it is a fight you can win.
For you are the Chosen one, sent by the divines to end
this evil."

Message:  1048
"Go now. And may the power of the divines go with you.
Should you fail, all of us will suffer! Good luck my
friend!"

Message:  1049
This is it. This is ___tomb_. Resting place
of the kings of Kagrath according to _akagrathtome_.

Message:  1050
"Who is there? Another victim of 'prophecy'? Ha ha!"

Message:  1051
"What ho? A %ra, and a %lev!
Another chop for the pot.
And what a big pot this is! Join me in this stew."
<ce>
The man is bloodied and wide-eyed with fatigue, he has
obviously been here some time and has lost his wits.

Message:  1052
"Oh ooh. Shhh. We must be quiet. They'll hear us. You'll
hear us. We all hear us. Am I them? Are you? Not yet, but
not long. For me. For you certainly"

Message:  1053
"Me? A am me. Who are you %ra? Where are my manners?
I am _madventurer_ of The Knights of the Owl.
Your name is unimportant. It won't be yours much longer.
Been here too long I have. I don't think I'll ever
leave. I want to be the last. Last of the poor saps
sent to 'save the world'. I want to see all your faces."

Message:  1054
"Do you have a book for me? I'm collecting them. Many
books have I. Many now. Not much variety though. And
some are damaged. Not much value. Did the collector
give you one? Or did you steal it? _akagrathtome_?
Did you steal or buy _bookofkagrath_?"

Message:  1055
"Was it the old man who sent you? Did he shake as he
told you of the weight of fate upon you? Or was he
shaking with laughter! Ha Haa!"
<ce>
He doubles over laughing then reaches into the pile
behind him and throws you some books.

Message:  1056
"Rare volumes! Unique! They probably stained them with
tea and singed the edges with candles. Every one different
works of art! I wipe my bottom with the pages every time
I soil myself! That adds even more timeless character!"

Message:  1057
He holds a copy of _akagrathtome_ up towards you,
"Let me read you some!"
<ce>
He thumbs roughly through the pages in an exaggerated
fashion, "I especially like this stanza, if... if you
don't mind?"

Message:  1058
Without awaiting an answer he immediately starts reciting
in an overly dramatic voice,
"Blibiddy blobbidy bloo, the cow did a poo,
"Fleghrty floogety whae, the prophecy has gone astray!"
<ce>
He quickly holds his shaking hand to his mouth,
"Oh ho! I may have accidentally ressurected ancient evil!
Here they come!!!"

Message:  1059
"Oh. You naughty Chosen one! You slew the ancient kings!
You are still playing the old role! Don't you understand!
Your role has been recast. The actor awaits the stage.
You must do the garb of the slain, the ancient kings!"

Message:  1065
"You were chosen. Now you are offal. Cattle. The bit
part. To be reborn! From cast-off to king! Don't you
understand! Chosen to be chosen. One of many playing
the unique! The clue is in the name! Play your part!"

Message:  1060
"PLAY! YOUR! PART!"

Message:  1061
A lightening bolt surgest past you and hits _madventurer_,
who jerks, stumbles and falls to the ground.
"Aaah! Not fair..."

Message:  1062
A young mage has arrived,
"%hnr! Hold your attack. I would speak to you."

Message:  1063
"I'm afraid I do not know who this dischevled man was,
he seemed dangerous and insane and in places like this
it is vital to take no chances. Let me introduce myself;
I am _adventurer_ of _tmg_ in
__tmg_. I am here on a quest of utmost
importance to the safety of ____tmg_!"

Message:  1064
You hold up your hand to stop _adventurer_.
Then tell %g2 about your own quest, then about
_madventurer_'s revelations and show the scattered
books. _adventurer_'s face falls.

Message:  1066
"Then... what, these... kings. This whole thing? My
brother was right. He's a historian. He'd never heard
of the Kagrath. I laughed at his lack of knowledge.
He was right... he... it... it was all a play."

Message:  1067
"Wait... more come! On your guard!"

Message:  1068
"The Kings of the Kagrath. These are just adventurers.
Like us. This one's even got a copy of the ruddy book!
We get used and then sent down here to die and become
fodder for the next poor saps. Probably after everything
of value is stripped from our corpses!"

Message:  1069
"We have to work together. Get out of here and then make
_fakeqgiver_ or whatever he calls himself pay!"

Message:  1070
You describe _questgiver_ to _adventurer_.
<ce>
"Said his name was _fakeqgiver_, but that's him
alright. What a piece of work! I'm sure that thief
and the book collector are in on it to. Something
wasn't right there. I bet that sick woman wasn't
even his mother!"

Message:  1071
"Let's get out of here, %pcf."

Message:  1072
You hear the sounds of more undead coming.

Message:  1073
"Wait! Wait! Wait!"
<ce>
The young mage stops and holds a hand to %g2 face,
"I'm sorry. I must inform you, I get side-tracked.
They don't consider me reliable at _tmg_ because
of my poor memory. I get all the low-end jobs no-one
else wants. I'm an idiot. That's what I am."

Message:  1074
"The point I'm making is... I was sent on a quest by
_tmg_ to find a rare herb in some caves.
I somehow ended up in an inn where that mollusc
_fakeqgiver_ suckered me in. Anyway..."

Message:  1075
_adventurer_ sees the look on your face,
"The point I'm making here is that they gave me a teleport
scroll back to _tmg_ in __tmg_."
<ce>
Rummaging around in %g2 bag %g pulls out some parchments,
"Actually because I'm such an ass I have two. We can just
teleport back. Sorry." 

Message:  1076
"Are you ready to go now? Don't worry, I didn't create
these. They are standard _tmg_ issue. They'll work."

Message:  1077
"Ok. If you think that's prudent... look. You take one.
Use it when you think you are ready."

Message:  1078
"Ok. Let's go... Though they won't be happy with me for
not getting those herbs from the cave. Hey. Maybe you
could help me with that later?"

Message:  1083
"Ok. You ok? Do you need to throw up? No. Ok. We need
to go see _bigmage_, %g must be told. Also you need to
help explain more coherently than me and cover me for
not doing that other thing. ok?"

Message:  1079
"Ahh, _adventurer_, there you are. Did you get lost
again? %fn really needs those herbs. Get them up to
her straight away!"
<ce>
He suddenly notices you. "Sorry, _adventurer_,
who is this?"

Message:  1080
You explain yourself and the situation, and _adventurer_
hands over copies of the books. The mage thumbs through
them and looks concerned.
<ce>
"We've heard whispers of 'The Kagrath'. Were ignoring
it as another stupid work of fiction being misinterpreted
by the uneducated, but if this is being used to entrap..."

Message:  1081
He suddenly looks grave.
<ce>
"A few of our acolytes have gone missing over the past few weeks,
like _adventurer_ here I just assumed they got waylaid
by their own curiosity, but..."

Message:  1082
"I've heard The Fighters Guild have mislaid a few of their
number recently too."
<ce>
"You two. Go and get cleaned up and rested. Meet me back
here on the morrow. I will speak to my opposite number
amongst the meatshields. This will need to be dealt with."

Message:  1084
"Oh, _adventurer_... I can assume you haven't got the
herbs yet? %fn won't be please. Won't be pleased at all."

Message:  1085
"We should head back to _tmg_. They are probably ready
for us now. _bigmage_ gets snappy when we tarry."

Message:  1086
"%pcn. Might I remind you that we have to meet with
_bigmage_. He's going to be really mardy with us given
the situation."

Message:  1087
"Enough %pcf! If you aren't heading back to _tmg_
then we are done. We'll handle this alone."

Message:  1088
"%pcn. _adventurer_. I spoke with _bigfighter_
from The Fighters Guild. We've agreed that this vile
trap must be dealt with, swiftly. There is no point
retracing your steps as our criminal friends will have
moved on no doubt."

Message:  1089
"However we have studied their books and from them
we have gleaned vital information. If not from the
gibberish written wtihin, but the books themselves.
The quality of paper, though damaged from their
attempts at falsifying their age, is from only one
press we are aware of in the region."

Message:  1090
"They are located at _printers_ in __printers_. Go
there and... speak to them. Firmly. Locate their
customer. End their scheme."

Message:  1091
"And _adventurer_. Don't come back until you've got
those herbs. We're also not giving you any more
teleport scrolls. A goat appeared here last week.
Don't try to deny that wasn't your scroll!"

Message:  1092
"%hnr. How may I help you? Would you like to place
an order?"
<ce>
You show him the books and ask them who they printed
them for.

Message:  1093
"Oh dear. These have... not been very well cared for.
I'm afraid rebinding won't really help in this
situation."
<ce>
"I am sorry. We don't share customer information.
We pride ourselves on discretion and satisfaction."

Message:  1094
You push the point, placing your hand on your weapon as
a gesture.

Message:  1095
"Ah. I see. This is highly irregular, but I'll see what
I can do. Excuse me a moment and I will check our files."
<ce>
The man leaves for the back room.

Message:  1096
He returns. With a pair of large gentlemen.
<ce>
"Ahem. =lg1_? =lg2_?
Please show these two the door. And perhaps some some
of our beautiful countryside. Up close."

Message:  1097
"Ok. Ok. I can see you are serious individuals.
Discretion and satisfaction be damned. Look, I...
I printed those books for someone called _scammer_.
I'm not sure where %g was from exactly as %g
collected most of them in person, but we delivered
some additional work to a place called _hovel_."

Message:  1098
"That's all I know. I swear!"

Message:  1099
An angry old man approaches you waving,
"Hey you! %ra! What are you doing here?
This is my land. I've had enough of you outsiders!"

Message:  1102
"I rented this place to a couple of city folk.
Smooth as a tots rump they were. Paid me for a month
in advance then nothing. Left this place a mess.
I'm out hundreds of septims. No more city folk!
Be off with you!"

Message:  1103
"I don't know who they were. Paid me with one
of them credit letters. That's no use to me.
When am I going to be in The Bank of ____bank_?
I've never even been to __bank_"

Message:  1104
"Yeah. Says The Bank of ____bank_. __bank_.
Go and speak to them. Ask them how am I going to get
my money? Credit letters. Bah!"

Message:  1107
"You can have it if you give me the _rent_ it's worth."

Message:  1108
"Right. Here you go. Maybe you can do something with
it in __bank_. No use to me. I prefer good old
fashioned coins. Now, off with you both!"

Message:  1109
"Bah"
<ce>
The old man turns to leave.

Message:  1110
"Wait!" cries _adventurer_.
<ce>
"That's probably important, %pcf! I'll pay him for it."

Message:  1111
"I don't care who pays. As long as I gets me coin!"

Message:  1105
"They won't just tell us who they issued this letter of
credit to, we should probably come at night when they
are closed and check around.
Yeah. I'm suggesting a bank robbery, but only for
information. Seriously."

Message:  1106
"Ok. Let's look around. Be quiet, but be quick!
And don't steal anything %pcf!."
<ce>
"I'm in enough trouble as it is."

Message:  1112
"Ok, this looks like the records for the issued credit
over the quarter..."

Message:  1115
"Ok, found the date... matching the amounts issued..."
<ce>
"Give me a few moments..."

Message:  1114
"Ah.."
<ce>
"Here we go. _scammer_..."
<ce>
"Address is listed as _scamhome_ in __scamhome_!"

Message:  1113
"Might be bogus, %pcf, but it's worth checking out."
<ce>
"Now put that box back where you found it and let's
get out of here."

Message:  1116
"%oth! We've been rumbled %pcf. Run for it!"

Message:  1117
"Ah. My dear friends %pcf and... I forgot your name.
Sorry. So glad you have come back. Did you manage
to stop the return of the Kagrathi Kings?"
<ce>
"I'm sorry. Probably no reason to continue with this.
I mean, you are both a couple of idiots, but still.."

Message:  1118
"No hard feelings eh? I'm sure you can appreciate the
lengths we went to in order to lure you in. Quite
elaborate you must admit. Took a lot of work on our
part. Month of planning and investment. Those books
weren't cheap you know, but I'll admit we came out on
top."

Message:  1119
"I won't insult your meagre intelligence by trying to
suggest you could get in on our little enterprise. We
mean to kill you both. You should have died in that
hole with the other morons and joined us as mindless
servants, but well. Here will be fine."

Message:  1120
A portal suddenly opens.

Message:  1123
Now you find yourself back in _tmg_, along with
_adventurer_ and _questgiver_, AKA _scammer_.

Message:  1121
"Welcome back. I'll take that locator stone back
_adventurer_. Those things are expensive,
and we don't trust you with expensive things.
Thank you."

Message:  1122
"=bm_ will escort _questgiver_ or
_scammer_ or whatever their name is,
to the dungeon. We will deal with %g2 later.
Necromancy is one of the most serious crimes in
____tmg_ and I feel %g3 punishment and those of his
accomplices will be... fitting. It's been a while
since we had a good meaty trial."

Message:  1124
"You both have done a great service. We have some
cleanup to do at _scamhome_. Maybe we can recover
some of what they stole, but I doubt any of our
missing acolytes will be of use to us in their 
current state."

Message:  1125
"For now, I can offer thanks, but we will take seriously
any losses you have incurred during this debacle and
forward onto you compensation taken from the guilty
party. I'd like to also think you will have earned
much wisdom from this experience."

Message:  1127
"Ok %pcf. This has been... fun, but I'm going to the
tavern. I'd still appreciate your help with finding
that herb if you are up for it?"

Message:  1126
A runner appears and hands you a letter.

Message:  1129
"Ah. %pcn. Here is your gold. Be careful
with it from now on.

Message:  1130
"I have nothing to say to you %ra! You were and
are an idiot."

Message:  1150
What's a cog-wrap?
<--->
I know that book. My brother uses a copy to prop up his kitchen table. He won't part with it less his eggs fall on the floor.
<--->
Never heard of it? Is it spicy?
<--->
Fell did he? Terrible. Was he badly hurt?

Message:  1151
_questgiver_? I don't know the name. Owe you money does %g?
<--->
Who?
<--->
_questgiver_? The name doesn't ring a bell? Is %g a bell ringer? Probably not a very good one in that case.

Message:  1152
_printer_? Is that %g2 that does books? Prints them? I can't afford books. I can't read. 

Message: 1153
_fakeqgiver_ told %fn that her boy was something special. Kid got ate by a _king7_.

Message:  1154
Owner has been trying to sell that place for years. I wouldn't use it as a latrine, though I hear some have.

Message:  1101
...and on that night we headed eastwards. We gathered up the
remains of =king2_ and =king3_. Slain as they were by the
mob of these primative hut dwellers, their bodies left to 
rot under the sun. With great reverence we placed them upon
our cart and hurried under the light of the moons to the
next battlefield. Singing our hymns under our breath and
cursing this land and all that crawled upon it...
<ce>
...at last we spied the place of interment. ___tomb_.
Weeping that we could not carry our kings back with us,
we carried their bodies into the chamber...
<ce>
...annointed with oils, their organs treated and placed
within the sacred jars...
<ce>
...of the sacred ritual to be performed on the night when
our moon is in position, the elders have hidden the texts
with those who will await the day when our kings shall
return to gather at the _tomb_...

Dear %pcn,

in order to collect your compension from the recent
incident at _scamhome_.

Compensation has been worked out as =reward_ septims.

Please collect this within =charity_ days otherwise the

%qdt:
I've been tasked by _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
to prevent the return of some ancient evil. I first
need to find out where the ancient evil is buried
and that requires me to go to an inn called
_tav_ in __tav_ and
get a map from a lowlife. I have =darkness_ days.

Message:  1201

_questgiver_ has given me a book called
_bookofkagrath_ and %g says I should read it
and get back to %g2 within =canyouevenread_ days,
then %g will tell me what I need to do.

Message:  1202
%qdt:
I met with _mapguy_ in _tav_.
I needed to slap %g2 around a bit, but %g agreed to
sell me the map.

Message:  1208
%qdt:
I met with _mapguy_ in _tav_.
I needed to slap %g2 around a bit, but %g agreed to
give me the map if I do %g2 a favour.

Message:  1203
%qdt:
I met with _mapguy_ in _tav_
but %g wouldn't give me the map.

Message:  1210
%qdt:
I got the map from _mapguy_. I should probably
read it and see where this tomb is.

Message:  1204
%qdt:
According to the map you got from _mapguy_
the burial place of =king1_ is beneath
___grave_.

Message: 1205
%qdt:
The Kagrath king flopped like a wet lettuce.
Something isnt right. I need to go back and
speak to _questgiver_ at __questgiver_
in ___questgiver_.

Message:  1206
%qdt:
_questgiver_ seemed quite flustered when I gave
him the news. He needs to do some research but begged
me to return to him at __questgiver_ in =research_ days.

Message: 1207
%qdt:
According to _questgiver_ I am The Chosen One who is
able to slay these Kagrathi kings and stop the lands
being covered in darkness. He needs me to retrieve some
ancient tome from a collector in ___noblehome_ that
will reveal where the remaining kings are buried so I
can slay them before they can amass an army.

Message:  1211
%qdt:
I got _akagrathtome_ from the house of the collector,
now to get it back to _questgiver_ in
___questgiver_.

Message:  1209
%qdt:
I gave _questgiver_ the _akagrathtome_.
He needs to take it to be translated and will let me
know when it has been done.

Message:  1212
%qdt:
The translation of _akagrathtome_ reveals
the burial mound of the last Kagrathi kings to be at
____tomb_. I must go there immediately to prevent
them all being raised or try to put them down if I'm
too late.

Message:  1213
%qdt:
This whole thing has been a scam to fleece gullible
adventurers and lure them into a pit to be turned into
zombies. I met another 'chosen' down there called
=madventurer_ and %g had met countless others. The
ancient tomes are fake, the Kagrath probably never
existed. Another young mage arrived on the same 'quest'
and we are now trying to escape so we can rain bloody
vengeance on _questgiver_ or _fakeqgiver_
or whatever his name is!

Message:  1214
%qdt:
We escaped from _tomb_ and made it to _tmg_
in __tmg_. Our story was embarrasing, but of
great interest to the mages who want to stop this
trickery at the source. They have given us a day to
recouperate and then we will track _questgiver_ down.

Message:  1215
%qdt:
The mages at _tmg_ have determined that the
books were printed at _printers_
in __printers_. We go there to see if they
can tell us who their customer is.

Message:  1216
%qdt:
The printer eventually told us they did the job for
someone called _scammer_ at ___hovel_.

Message: 1217
%qdt:
The old man who owns ___hovel_ told us that he was
paid with a letter of credit from _bank_ in
__bank_. That is our next port of call.

Message:  1218
%qdt:
At _bank_ we found records for the letter of credit
that point to _scamhome_ in __scamhome_.
