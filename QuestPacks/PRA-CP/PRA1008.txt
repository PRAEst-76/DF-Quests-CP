I've never heard of a Kagrath, but they sound scary. I hope there is none around here.

"Tell me, have you read _bookofkagrath_? Do you know
the terrible bloody history of these ancient peoples?"

Message:  1016
"Hmm. The history is not well known. Only few scolars
have bothered to research it and it is not oft
found in libraries. I hope you do not mind if I test
your knowledge?"
<ce>
"Tell me if the following is true or false. Ahem..." 

Message:  1017
"The Chosen came from the east"

Message: 1018
"The Aldmeri drove the Kagrath into the sea."

Message:  1019
"The Chosen's name was %mn"

Message: 1020
He sighs and holds out an old book to you,
"This book, _bookofkagrath_ will explain.
It is important to read it, and know the history.
Once you understand the weight of our task return
and speak to me."

Message:  1021
"So now you know the history, you should know
that a daedric cult has apparently found the resting
place of the first of these Kagrath kings, Kahfciel,
and they plan to raise him. They are fools and know
not the evil they will unleash upon these lands!"

Message:  1022
"They must be stopped. Go to _tav_ in
__tav_ and find one of their number, they are
known to frequent there, they will have a map to
the grave. Get it from them by whatever means you
deem fit."

Message:  1023
"What do you want %ra? I'm busy."

Message:  1024
"You want what? I'm not telling you nothing!
Now get lost!"
<ce>
<ce>Beat it out of him?

Message:  1025
Ok, ok! Look. I got to live. These people... if they knew.
I just want to get out of this ok. Go back to my
family. I can sell you the map. Then I can get away.
<ce>
<ce>Buy the map?

Message:  1026
"Look. I really need the money. I want to make a break.
A better life for myself and my kids. If you can't pay me
for the map you'll have to kill me for it and take it
from my corpse! There's another way though...
This way you get the map and I get enough coin to start
a new life. Deal?"

Message:  1027
"No, wait! It's not supposed to go this way!"

Message:  1028
The map shows the way to ___grave_.
That'll be where they are planning to raise this dead
ancient king.

Message:  1029
You are at the purported grave of Kahfciel.

Message:  1030
"Quickly. Complete the ritual!"

Message:  1031
"Nyar shthan, Nyar gashanna!"

Message:  1032
"You are too late, %ra! Kahfciel is risen!"

Message:  1033
Looks like you've killed the unkillable, and the
cultists have done a runner. Maybe it's time to go
back and tell _questgiver_?

Message:  1034
"You return. Please tell me you were successful in
tracking down the resting place of Kahfciel and
preventing his ressurection?"

Message:  1035
"Wh... what? You killed him? This cannot be. No. Are
you certain he was dead? The cultists fled? This...
I cannot..."

Message:  1036
"I must think. I must study the prophcied texts! Please
Give me a day. Come back tomorrow. I... I will speak to
you then. Here. Please. This is... profound. Tomorrow."

Message: 1037
"You have returned. Ah. I have great news. It appears we
have been blessed. In the darkest of hours. We have been
blessed. You were able to slay Kahfciel because you are
the chosen!"

Message:  1038
"The gods have placed you here with their power to drive
back the undead Kagrath hordes for good. You must find their
remaining resting places and destroy them forever."

Message: 1039
"To do this, we must know where the rest were buried.
This is not something commonly known, however it was
belived that some Kagrathi gathered up the remains of
their fallen kings and interred them in a secret tomb
before they fled these lands."

Message:  1040
"They kept a journal, one copy that was believed lost forever,
however I have learned that it may still exist in the
private collection of a noble. If they have the book then we
must retrieve it, by any means necessary."

Message:  1041
"You must go now, to _noblehome_ and find that
book. It is our only chance to slay them before they
raise an army to recover the lands in darkness"

I've been tasked by _questgiver_ to prevent the
return of some ancient evil. I first need to find
out where the ancient evil is buried and that
requires me to go to some dive called _tav_ in
__tav_ and get a map from some lowlife.

Message:  1201
%qdt:
_questgiver_ has given me a book called
_bookofkagrath_. He says I should read it
and get back to him, then he will tell me what I
need to do.

Message:  1202
%qdt:
I needed to slap the guy around, but he said he'd
sell me the map.

Message:  1203
%qdt:
The guy wouldn't give me the map.

Message:  1204
%qdt:
I got the map. The grave is at ___grave_.

Message: 1205
%qdt:
The Kagrath king flopped like a wet lettuce.
Something isnt right. I need to go back and
speak to _questgiver_

Message:  1206
%qdt:
_questgiver_ seemed quite flustered when I gave
him the news. He needs to do some research but begged
me to return in =research_ days.

Message: 1207
%qdt:
According to _questgiver_ I am The Chosen One who is
able to slay these Kagrathi kings and stop the lands
being covered in darkness. He needs me to find some
ancient tomb of theres that will reveal where the
remaining kings are buried so I can slay them before
they can amass an army.
