"How small she seems. Like when... No matter. The
deed is done. This family thanks you, or they

"There is but one more step. I shall prepare her
remains. If you wish to help me see this through
and return my beautiful daughter to this world
and her beloved then return this time tomorrow."
<ce>
"I shall tell you what needs to be done then.
For now, take this small payment for your deeds
thus far and go and rest at the local inn.
You have earned it, and more my friend."

Message:  1048
"You return once more. Good. I was concerned you
would have been reluctant to help any further.
I'll admit this is a diffcult task, for you and
for us. But a necessary one."
