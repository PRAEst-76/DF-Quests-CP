QuestorOffer:  [1000]
Dear %pct, you could help me. If you would?
You see I have an urgent meeting with a person
of note and cannot find someone to take care of
my child, _child_.
Can you please just look after %g2 for a short
time.
I should not be more than an hour. Then I will
return and take %g2 again and pay you.
Please.
This is very important. Our future depends on it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
Oh no! What shall we do now?
My poor child!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Oh! Thank you. Thank you!
I shall not be long. I promise.
Merely an hour or so. No longer.
I will meet you at my home, once my business has
concluded.
I shall be at _house_ in
__house_ in around six hours.
No longer. I promise. Maybe twelve.
I shall return in no less than a day.
Please take care of my child!
See you tomorrow!

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                You failed to take care of the child.
You are a bad babysitter.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   The child is now safely in care.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_questgiver_ is a terrible mother. Always pawning that poor child off on strangers so she can do her "business"
<--->
I heard that _questgiver_ just left her kid alone with some %ra. Some awful parents in this town and no mistake.
<--->
That _friend_ just yelled at me in the street last week. For absolutely nothing.
<--->
Some people just dump their kids with any old riff-raff these days.
<--->
Saw some streetwalker picking up tricks with a toddler under her arm the other day. Probably a foreigner.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Did you hear about that poor child? Just terrible.
<--->
Awful news about that poor kid. With parents like that it didn't have a chance.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I feel for poor _child_. Parents like that...
<--->
_child_ is being cared for at the temple. Sad news about his mother.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Thank you.

Message:  1030
%qdt
A lady called _questgiver_ has talked me into
minding her child while she goes to...
do something or other.
She promises she'll come back to retrieve him
soon, but was unspecific as to when.
I am to return the child to _house_
in __house_... at some stage.

Message:  1031
%qdt
A man called _father_ who claims to be the child's
father stopped me and demanded the child.
He claimed the child's mother was an unfit parent
and demanded I turn the child over to him.

Message:  1032
The man seemed sincere, also desperate and
somewhat threatening.
I hope I did the right thing.

Message:  1033
The man seemed desperate and threatening. So I
refused his request. One of his associates
attempted to ambush me.

Message:  1034
He snatched the child in the struggle, and
vanished. I don'k know where he went. I guess I
need to go speak to _questgiver_ at
_house_. Maybe she knows who he is.
This won't be easy.

Message:  1035
%qdt
I called at _house_ but _questgiver_
wasn't home yet.
<ce>
She seems to be taking a long time. Her housemate
was unhelpful.
I will need to return later.

Message:  1036
%qdt
_questgiver_ was understandably very upset. She
claimed the man was not the child's father.
However she seemed to know who he was and told
me to speak to a woman called _sister_
who is seemingly this man's sister who lives
in __sishouse_.

Message:  1037
%qdt
_sister_ was... unhelpful.
There might be something in her home that will
point me in the direction of _father_. Otherwise
it's back to asking the locals.

Message:  1038
%qdt
Apparently _father_ is in a house called
_culthome_ in __culthome_. He's probably not
going to just hand over the child willingly.
I'll need to think about how to handle this.

Message:  1039
%qdt
They asked me to leave _culthome_.
Said the child will have a better life there.
Place stank of evil.

Message:  1040
%qdt
I've got the child. Now to get him back to his
mother.

Message:  1041
%qdt
_father_ has taken off with the kid after setting
his men on me.
I'll need to look around for clues as to where he
may have gone.

Message:  1042
%qdt
It seems _father_ has another shady property
called _cultdun_ in ___cultdun_.
I guess I should look there.

Message:  1043
%qdt
It appears _father_ was injured in the
struggle before he fled.
I'm going to try to follow his blood trail.

Message:  1044
%qdt
_father_ is dead. I didn't badly injure
him, so I can only assume he met his end from
the squatters in _cultdun_.
The child is ok. It looks like he was trying
to protect the kid. Maybe he really was his
father.
Now to take the kid and get out of here.

Message:  1045
In a tragic twist it seems _questgiver_
has succumbed to what her unsympathetic
landlady termed "an accident". She implied this
wasn't the first, but is possibly the last.
I should see the priest, _priest_ at
_temple_ in __temple_ who is taking care of her.

-- Dialog
Message:  1100
Halt stranger. That is my child you have there.
I am _father_, his father and a man of means.
I demand you turn him over to me. His mother is a
drunk and a whore and I'm sick of her leaving him
with strangers like you while she plies her wares
in back alleys.
<ce>
Turn him over now and you will depart with your life.

Message:  1101
You have done the right thing stranger.
<ce>
This child will have no life of consequence with
that strop. I will take him far from this place
and see his life is rich and fullfiling.

Message:  1102
I will not risk my child's life by attacking you
directly.
<ce>
No.
<ce>
I will find some other way to retrieve my child.
<ce>
I will bide my time. Waiting for the right moment
for you to be distracted talking to me while my
brother attacks from behind!

Message:  1103
_questgiver_? No. She is not here. I know not
where she is.
<ce>
And no. I will not take the child, so don't even
ask. You agreed to do this, any risk is on your
hands.
<ce>
I let _questgiver_ doss here, but I
don't get involved beyond that.
<ce>
Be off with you. Return when she does.
I will speak with you no longer.

Message:  1109
Look. I told you she's not here!
<ce>
Come back when she is.
<ce>
I don't know where she is! I never know where
she is! Now get out!

Message:  1104
Oh. You are the person _questgiver_
employed to take care of _child_.
It is good you have returned.
I fear _questgiver_ is deathly ill.
She had an... accident.
She is at _temple_.
Take her child to her.
_priest_ is taking care of her there.

Message:  1105
You return. Good.
<ce>
Where... where is my baby?

Message:  1106
You what?!
<ce>
You fool, his father is dead! You have given my
baby to a cult!
<ce>
Oh no!!! You monster. You monster! My baby!
<ce>
Go! Get my child!
<ce>
If you are good for anything you will undo what
you have done before... before they...
<ce>
Go you idiot! What are you waiting for?!
<ce>
<ce>                  Do you agree to retrive the Child?

Message:  1107
Aaah! No! Nononono!
<ce>
My baby!
<ce>
You've killed my baby!!

Message:  1108
I don't know where they are, but you might want
to speak to _sister_ in __sishouse_.
She might know. She is his sister.
They used to be close.
Too close!
Go! Find her!
Make her tell you where they are.
Ask people! Do something!!
Get my baby!

Message:  1110
Oh my, what a cute little button! Looks just like
you!
<ce>
I know they all say that, but this one really
does. The absolute spit!

Message:  1111
Adventuring is a bit of a difficult life for a
child though isn't it? With all those nasty
monsters and Orcs and bandits and such coming at
you all the time with their great big weapons
out...
<ce>
Where do you keep the child during your questin'?
In a bag or do you have someone that holds 'em
for you while you get to slayin' and lootin'?
<ce>
<ce>                            Interrupt her?

Message:  1112
Is the little one on solids now?
<ce>
Eating his carrots?
<ce>
Carrots are good for the hair I believe. Might
make it red though and no-one wants a red haired
child.
<ce>
Perish the thought!

Message:  1113
Ours went to school in Wayrest of course. Just
the best for ours. She turned out well. Works for
the bank there now. Doesn't have red hair.
<ce>
You might want to consider that kind of life for
your child.
<ce>
<ce>                         Tell her to shut up?

Message:  1114
I mean, it's not for me to judge. That's your
child. Just saying that I think your line of work
isn't a great life for a child.
<ce>
Very dangerous.

Message:  1115
Look at me rabbiting on like this. I really must
be off. Those messages won't run themselves.
<ce>
And I've got to meet %fn to let her
in on the latest gossip.

Message:  1116
Oh, speaking of which; did you hear the latest
about %fn?
<ce>
She's got herself a new man! Sure her husband is
barely cold.
<ce>
Didn't wait long for that. I guess they don't
wait these days.
<ce>
<ce>                            Just walk off?

Message:  1117
I see that _father_ was seen doing
some business at The Bank of
____culthome_.
<ce>
Suspicious one that if you ask me. The sister is
no better. If she even is his sister. Something
funny going on there.

Message:  1118
Anyways. Must be off.
<ce>
Take care of that little one when you are doing
yer murderous speluking won't you?

Message:  1119
And don't let her eat any carrots.
<ce>
You know what that causes!

Message:  1120
How awfully rude. I guess parents these days just
aren't up to much. Hmph.

Message:  1122
Thank you for taking care of my baby. I hope he
didn't give you too much trouble. I know he can
be a handful at times.

Message:  1123
Here, I have some money for you. I shall also
reccomend your services to all my friends.

Message:  1125
Yes, I am _sister_. What do you want?

Message:  1126
_father_? Who sent you? No matter, I'll send you
back to them in peices.

Message:  1135
I know why you are here. She sent you! She is a
drunken sot, not fit to be a mother, but no
matter.
You may leave.
Tell her whatever.
If she shows up here she will be killed as a
trespasser, as will you.
The child stays with me.

Message:  1138
We are watching you %ra. Don't try anything.

Message:  1136
You were warned.
<ce>
Men!

Message:  1137
You won't take the child!

Message:  1139
I'm glad you arrived. _questgiver_ is gravely ill.
Her life choices have taken their toll I fear.

Message:  1140
Oh, the child is taken? Oh no!
<ce>
I think we should keep this news from her for
now. It will not help her in her situation.
<ce>
Please do your best to retrieve him! He should be
reunited with his mother before... well.

Message:  1141
I'm glad you have returned. _questgiver_ does not
have long. This life of hers has punished her
greatly.
<ce>
Perhaps seeing this little one safe will help
ease her passing.

Message:  1143
_child_ will be tended to under our care.
Life in _temple_ is not a bad one. Perhaps %g
will grow up to help poor lost souls like those
of %g3 parents.
<ce>
This has been a sad tale, and one that we see
repeated so often.
Take care of any young ones you find.
Guide them as you can. This world is a harsh arena.

Message:  1144
The _temple_ is not wealthy,
but we have gathered a small sum to reumburse
you.
I hope also you take away the reward of helping
those less fortunate than yourself.

Message:  1145
I am so glad to see you have brought the child
back to us. If only his dear lost mother could
still see him.

Message:  1146
I see your received my letter.
You do not have the child? This troubling.
The father you say? She did not mention him,
though she cursed someone in her fever.
<ce>
If you could somehow retrieve the child from
this man and return him to us, he would be well
taken care of.

Message:  1147
You are the one who took the child,
_child_.
<ce>
I see you have him with you. Have you brought
him back to us?

Message:  1148
We will see he is taken care of. You have done
the right thing. We will see to it that the
Knights are informed and there is no further
need to look for you.

Beloved Sister,
<ce>
We have purchased a building in __culthome_
to be our base of operations.
Once I have retrieved my child from that wench
I shall take him with me to be raised in
accordance with the rules of our Lord.
<ce>
Once your tasks in __sishouse_ are complete
you should ride with haste to join us so we
may begin in earnest.

Message:  1202
Dear _father_,
<ce>
It has come to the attention of the regional
safety commission that a property of yours in
____cultdun_, namely __cultdun_
does not reach the safety standards for the
area.
A recent survey performed found that it met only
2 of the 5 criteria for passable status.
<ce>
Under ____cultdun_ law you now have
90 days to bring the property up to legal code
or The RSC of ____cultdun_ will
be forced to issue a condemnation notice that
could result in a fine and the property being
declared unfit for habitation/trade/perfomance*.

Message:  1207
Dear %pcn,
<ce>
I am writing to inform you that poor
_questgiver_ passed away this morning. I did not
think she would hold out that long given how ill
she was but I believe she wanted to see her child
one last time. It was unfortunate that this could
not be so.
<ce>
I'm sure there is a good reason you have not
returned with little _child_ and I hope
he is safe in your care.
<ce>
However if you can bring him back to us at the
temple we will see to it that he is given a home
and a loving family.
<ce>
He has been through enough at such a young age.
<ce>
                        Yours in Faith,

Message:  1208
%pcn
It has been reported to us that you have taken
a child that does not belong to you. You are to
return this child immediately to any temple to
be cared for. We will not broker any excuses.
He was tended into your care by his late mother
and as such it is your responsibily to return
him.
<ce>
If this letter finds it's way to you, then be
assured we will also.
<ce>
Do the right thing.

Well, you know what they say. If you can't say anything nice...
<--->
I feel sorry for that child. Father run off. Mother a drunk.
<--->
I've seen _questgiver_ in alleys with strange men.
<--->
Seen her worse for wear a few times. That poor child.

Message:  1204
Horrible woman that.
<--->
Takes in all kinds that one. Soft heart under all that stone.
<--->
Wouldn't want to get into an argument with that one.

Message:  1205
That's a rum character and no mistake.
<--->
Very close with his sister I hear. Very close.
<--->
He and his friends have been buying property in ___culthome_ I hear.

Message:  1206
Very close with her brother I hear. Very close.
<--->
Very shady character. I'd avoid that one if I was you.

Lives in __sishouse_. Alone, but seems to have all sorts coming and going. All sorts.

a song?

Message:  1314
<ce>           The child has been soothed by your dulcet tones.

Message:  1315
<ce>        No. That's actually made the child even more unhappy.

<ce>                Good thing you noticed before leaving.
<ce>                    That could have been awkward.

Message:  1326
<ce>          Also, that statue is not at all appropriate for a

Halt! You are in possession of stolen merchandise!
Turn it over or face the consequences!

Message:  1329
<ce>            Oh no. Looks like the kid grabbed a malachite
<ce>                         statue in the store.
<ce>
<ce>            Also, that's not the kind of statue you really
<ce>                      want the kid playing with.
<ce>
<ce>                  Do you hand it over to the guard?

Message:  1330
Good %ra. I'll let this slip this time, but try
to keep your child out of theivery. I imagine
he's not a guild member, so it won't just be us
he needs to worry about next time.

You get me?

Message:  1332
<ce>           You spot a street trader selling snacks. Mainly
<ce>           some kind of meat on a stick. Not ideal, but you

<ce>
<ce>                               Buy one?

Message:  1333
<ce>           The kid wants a red one. Those look quite spicy,
<ce>             get him one of those instead of the regular?

Message:  1334
<ce>                    The kid seemed to enjoy that.

Message:  1337

<ce>            While you were dealing with the harpy the kid
<ce>            dozed off. He's also apparently eaten some of

<ce>              _culthome_. Is that where he has the kid?

Message:  1349

<ce>            It looks like he was injured but got the child
<ce>                  to relative safety before he died.

Message:  1351
<ce>A street urchin of the usual sort calls you
