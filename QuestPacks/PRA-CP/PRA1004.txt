QuestorOffer:  [1000]
The flustered young woman touches your arm "Dear
%pct, you could help me. If you would?"
<ce>
"You see I have an urgent meeting with a person
of note and cannot find someone to take care of
my child, _child_."
<ce>
"Can you please just watch him for a short
time."
She avoids your gaze. "I should not be more than
an hour. Two at most. Then I will return and take
him off your hands and pay you. Please?"
<ce>
"This is a very important meeting. Our future...
his future depends on it."

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
She looks crest-fallen. "Oh no! What shall we do
now?"
<ce>
"My poor, poor child!"

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
"Oh! Thank you... Thank you!"
<ce>
"Here he is. I shall not be long. I promise.
Only a few hours. No longer. Honest. I will meet
you at my home, once my business has concluded."
<ce>
She turns to leave, "I shall be at _house_
in around six hours. No longer. I promise. Maybe twelve..."
<ce>
The woman heads for the door, "I shall return in no less
than a day. Please take care of my beautiful boy!
I love you."
<ce>
"See you tomorrow, %pcf!" and with that she is gone.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                You failed to take care of the child.
You are a bad babysitter.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   The child is now safely in care.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_questgiver_ is a terrible mother. Always pawning that poor child off on strangers so she can do her "business"
<--->
I heard that _questgiver_ just left her kid alone with some %ra. Some awful parents in this town and no mistake.
<--->
That _friend_ just yelled at me in the street last week. For absolutely nothing.
<--->
Some people just dump their kids with any old riff-raff these days.
<--->
Saw some streetwalker picking up tricks with a toddler under her arm the other day. Probably a foreigner.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Did you hear about that poor child? Just terrible.
<--->
Awful news about that poor kid. With parents like that it didn't have a chance.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I feel for poor _child_. Parents like that...
<--->
_child_ is being cared for at the temple. Sad news about his mother.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Thank you for everything you did for _child_

Message:  1030
%qdt:
A lady called _questgiver_ has talked me into
minding her child while she goes to do something
or other.
<ce>
She promises she'll come back soon, but was
unclear how soon.
<ce>
I am to return the child to her at her home 
_house_ in __house_
whenever she eventually returns from her meeting.
<ce>
I should check there later.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
A man called _father_ who claims to be the
child's father stopped me.
<ce>
He said the child's mother was an unfit parent and
demanded I turn the kid over to him.

Message:  1032
The man seemed sincere, but also desperate and
somewhat threatening.
<ce>
I hope I did the right thing giving him the kid.

Message:  1033
The man seemed desperate and threatening. So I
refused his request. One of his associates
attempted to ambush me.

Message:  1034
He snatched the child during the struggle, and
vanished. I don't know where he went. I guess I
need to go speak to _questgiver_ at
_house_. Maybe she knows who
he is.
<ce>
This won't be easy.

Message:  1048
Someone, probably one of _father_'s associates
snatched the kid when I was distracted. I've no
idea where they went.
<ce>
I'll need to give the bad news to _questgiver_.
Maybe she knows where they might have taken him.

Message:  1035
%qdt:
I called at _house_ but _questgiver_
wasn't home yet.
<ce>
She seems to be taking a long time. Her housemate
was unhelpful. I will need to return later.

Message:  1036
%qdt:
_questgiver_ was understandably very upset. She
claimed the man was not the child's father.
However she seemed to know who he was and told me to
speak to a woman called _sister_
who is seemingly this man's sister who lives
in __sishouse_.

Message:  1037
%qdt:
_sister_ was... unhelpful, and tried to kill me,
which would be somewhat of an over-reaction for
someone with nothing to hide. She fled before I
could get any information out of her.

Message:  1047
%qdt:
_sister_ was... unhelpful, and tried to kill me,
I was forced to slay her and her associates.

Message:  1043
There might be something in her home that will
point me in the direction of _father_. Otherwise
it's back to asking around.

Message:  1040
She had an invoice for a horse and lodgings at
_remtav_ in ___remtav_.
Perhaps that is where she is heading?

Message:  1038
According to a letter she had on her, _father_
is in __culthome_ at _culthome_.
He's probably not going to just hand over the child
willingly. I'll need to think about how to handle this.

Message:  1039
%qdt:
Found the kid at _culthome_ with his
"father" and his friends. They asked me to leave
and said the child will have a better life there.

Message:  1049
Can I just leave the child there? They seem
resourceful, but also dangerous. Getting the
kid away from them will be hard and bloody.
Maybe he is better off there?

Message:  1041
_father_ has taken off with the kid after setting
his men on me.
I'll need to look around for clues as to where he
may have gone.

Message:  1042
_father_ has taken off with the kid after setting
his men on me.
According to a note I found it seems he has another
shady property in ____cultdun_ called
___cultdun_.
Perhaps that is where he has fled to?

Message:  1044
%qdt:
_father_ is dead. I didn't badly injure
him, so I can only assume he met his end from
the squatters in _cultdun_.
The child is ok. It looks like he was trying
to protect the kid. Maybe he really was his
father.
Now to take the kid and get out of here.

Message:  1045
%qdt:
In a tragic twist it seems _questgiver_
has succumbed to what her unsympathetic
landlady termed "an accident". She implied this
wasn't the first, but is possibly the last.
I should see the priest, _priest_ at
_temple_ in __temple_ who is
taking care of her.

Message:  1046
%qdt:
_questgiver_ is dying. _priest_ implored me to
try to return the child to them before she does.

Message:  1100
"Halt, stranger!" he says, holding up his hand.
You notice the other hovers near his belt.
<ce>
"That is my child you have there. I am
_father_, his father and a man of means.
I demand you turn him over to me! His mother is
a drunk and a whore, and I'm sick of seeing her
leaving him with strangers like you while she
plies her wares in back alleys!"
<ce>
He glares at you menacingly. "Turn him over now
and you will depart with your life."

Message:  1101
He takes the child from you. "You have done the
right thing stranger."
<ce>
"This child will have no life of consequence with
that strop. I will take him far from this place
and see his life is rich and fullfiling."
<ce>
And with that he departs, you notice at this
point he was not alone.

Message:  1102
His expression doesn't change, but you detect a
flicker behind his eyes. "I will not risk my
child's life by attacking you directly."
<ce>
"No." he says, shaking his head.
<ce>
"I will find some other way to retrieve my child."
<ce>
"I will bide my time. Waiting for the right moment
for you to be distracted talking to me while my
brother attacks from behind!"
<ce>
What was that?

Message:  1103
The woman snaps at you. "_questgiver_?
No. She is not here. I know not where she is."
<ce>
"And no. I will not take the child, so don't even
ask. You agreed to do this, any risk is on your
hands." She holds up her own for emphasis.
<ce>
"I let _questgiver_ doss here, but I don't
get involved beyond that."
<ce>
She gestures at you dismissively. "Be off with
you. Return when she does. I will speak with you
no longer."

Message:  1109
She looks irritated to see you return. "Look. I
told you she's not here!"
<ce>
"Come back when she is."
<ce>
She replies before you get a chance to speak. "I
don't know where she is! I never know where she
is! She could be out all night. She's dissapeared
for days before. I don't care! Now get out!"

Message:  1104
The woman looks distracted. "Oh. You are the
%ra _questgiver_ employed to take care
of _child_."
"It is good you have returned."
She rubs her hands together nervously. "I fear
_questgiver_ is deathly ill. She had an...
accident."
<ce>
"She is at _temple_. Take her child to
her there.
A priest called _priest_ is taking care
of her. Speak to him. I've done all I can."
<ce>
"Please go."

Message:  1105
She seems preoccupied already. "You return. Good."
<ce>
She looks you over, as if seeing you for the
first time. A look of alarm and confusion crosses
her face, followed by fear. "Where... where is my
baby? Where is my baby boy?"

Message:  1106
_questgiver_'s face is twisted with panic
and rage. "You what?!"
<ce>
"You fool, his father is dead! You have given my
baby to a cult!"
<ce>
She holds her hands to her face, tears welling up
in her eyes. "Oh no! No no no!!!"
<ce>
She yells at you, her hands clenched into fists.
"You monster! You monster! My baby!"
<ce>
"If you are good for anything you will undo what
you have done before... before they..." she tails
off, then recovers her rage, "Go you idiot!
What are you waiting for?!"
<ce>
<ce>                  Do you agree to find her child?

Message:  1107
"Aaah! No! Nononono!" she yells, doubling over as
if in pain.
<ce>
"My baby! My sweet baby!"
<ce>
She pulls herself upright again, glaring at you,
eyes full of madness, "You've... you've killed my
baby!! My baaabiiieee!!!"

Message:  1108
Some of her anger dissapates, to be replaced only
by exhaustion and frustration. "I don't know
where they are, but..." she thinks, "You might
try to speak to _sister_ in
__sishouse_. She might know. She is his
sister,I think."
<ce>
"They used to be close. Too close!" You notice
some anger returns. "Go! Find her! Find my baby!
Make her tell you where they are."
<ce>
"Go! Ask people! Do something!!"
<ce>
"Find my baby!!" and with that she slumps
exhaustedly to the floor.
<ce>
"Find my baby..."

Message:  1110
The lady stands a little too close, smelling of
a mixture of old flowers, spices and leaked
bodily fluids. She prods at the kid with a
extended bony digit. "Oh my, what a cute little
button she is! And looks just like you!"
<ce>
"I know they all say that, but this one really
does. The absolute spit!"

Message:  1111
She smiles at the child while she continues,
"Adventuring is a bit of a difficult life for a
child though isn't it? With all those nasty
monsters and Orcs and bandits and such coming at
you all the time with their great big weapons
out..."
<ce>
She makes a silly face at the kid who stares back
at her not knowing whether to return the smile or
cry. "Where do you keep the child during all your
questin'? In a bag or do you have someone that
holds 'em for you while you get to slayin' and
lootin' and the like?"
<ce>
<ce>                            Interrupt her?

Message:  1112
"Is the little one on solids now? Eating her
carrots?"
<ce>
She nods to herself. "Carrots are good for the
hair so they say. Might make it red though, and
no-one wants a red haired child."
<ce>
She grins toothlessly at the child, "No, they
certainly don't!"

Message:  1113
She attempts an air of sophistication, "Ours went
to school in Wayrest of course. Just the best for
her. She turned out well. Works for the bank there
now. Doesn't have red hair."
<ce>
She addresses you patronisingly, "You might want to
consider that for your little girl."
<ce>
<ce>                         Tell her to shut up?

Message:  1114
She closes her eyes and dismissively shakes her
head, "I mean, it's not for me to judge. And 
don't think I am. That's your child. Just saying,
as a lady of years, that I think your line of
work isn't the best life for a child."
<ce>
"No offense. I just think it's rather dangerous."

Message:  1115
"Look at me rabbiting on like this. I really must
be off. Those messages won't run themselves."
<ce>
"And I've got to meet %fn to let her
in on the latest gossip."
<ce>
She turns to leave.

Message:  1116
She turns back to you, "Oh, speaking of which;
did you hear the latest about %fn?"
<ce>
She doesn't wait for a response, "She's got
herself a new man! A %ra. Sure her husband is
barely cold."
<ce>
"Didn't wait long for that. I guess they don't
wait these days."
<ce>
You won't get a word in edgeways here.
<ce>
<ce>                            Just walk off?

Message:  1117
"Oh, and I see that _father_ was spotted
doing some business at The Bank of
____culthome_."
<ce>
"Suspicious one that if you ask me. The sister is
no better. If she even is his sister. Something
funny going on there." She screws up her face.

Message:  1118
"Anyways. Must be off. I'm sure you've things to
do. The little one will need din-dins soon."
<ce>
"Take care of that little blessing when you are
doing yer murderous speluking won't you?"

Message:  1119
"And don't let her eat any carrots!"
<ce>
"You know what that causes! And no man will want
that." and with that last peice of worldly
advice, she leaves. You decide to go elsewhere
quickly in case she comes back.

Message:  1120
"How awfully rude. I guess parents these days just
aren't up to much. Hmph."
<ce>
She spits on the ground and shuffles off.

Message:  1122
_questgiver_ looks different. Less distracted.
More relaxed. Quite relaxed. She quickly takes
the child back off you again.
<ce>
"Thank you for taking care of my baby. I hope he
didn't give you too much trouble. I know he can
be a handful at times."

Message:  1123
"Here, I have some money for you." she reaches
into a tatty purse and pulls out some coin,
"I shall also reccomend your services to all my
friends."

Message:  1125
The striking woman eyes you cautiously.
"Yes, I am _sister_. What do you want?"

Message:  1126
"_father_?" she becomes defensive.
<ce>
"Who sent you? No matter... I'll send you back to
them in tiny peices!" she draws her blade.

Message:  1127
_sister_ looks up, startled by your appearence,
"How did you find me! No matter... You'll not
find my brothers! You'll not leave here alive!"
<ce>
She calls out "_broker_! To my aid!"
<ce>
It very much seems that she's not going to
willingly tell you what you need to know.

Message:  1135
_father_ stands before you defiantly.
"I know why you are here, %ra. She sent you to
find us! I am surprised she cares enough to make
the effort, but she is a drunken sot and harlot,
not fit to be a mother or much else for that
matter."
<ce>
He shakes his head, "However, that is irrelevant
now. The child is safe here with his father, I
can assure you of that."
<ce>
He points at the door "You may leave. Now. Tell
_questgiver_ whatever you wish."
<ce>
"The world cares not a wit for her or her kind,
but if she should show up here, she will be killed
as a trespasser... as will you if you ever dare
to return. We shall depart here for... a place
that is not your concern, but soon. Do not look
for us again. You will find only death."

Message:  1328
"Halt! You are in possession of stolen merchandise!
Turn it over or face the consequences!"

Message:  1330
"Good %ra. I'll let this slip this time, but try
to keep your child out of theivery. I imagine
he's not a guild member, so it won't just be us
he needs to worry about next time."
<ce>
"You get me?"

Message:  1331
"Then you leave me no choice but to take you in.
You can come quietly or... not so quietly."

Message:  1138
You enter unaccosted, but many eyes are on you.
Many hands are on the hilts of many weapons.
<ce>
"We are watching you %ra. Don't try anything!
He is waiting to speak to you. Through there."

Message:  1136
_father_'s eyes narrow "You were warned."
<ce>
"Men!" he calls, and the whole building turns
upon you...

Message:  1137
_father_ yells out "You won't take the child!"
<ce>
He grabs young _child_ and runs for another exit
with his men covering him.

Message:  1139
The priest looks concerned, "I'm glad you arrived.
_questgiver_ is gravely ill. Her life choices have
finally taken their toll I fear."

Message:  1140
His look of concern turns to shock, "Oh! The
child is taken? Oh no!"
<ce>
He takes you aside, "I think we should keep this
news from her for now. It will not help her in
her situation."
<ce>
"Please do your best to retrieve him! He should be
reunited with his mother before... well." he looks
at the floor with a hand on your arm.

Message:  1141
"I'm glad you have returned. _questgiver_
does not have long. This life of hers has
punished her greatly."
<ce>
"Perhaps seeing this little one safe will help
ease her passing."
<ce>
He passes the child onto an acolyte who takes him
to his dying mother.

Message:  1143
"_child_ will be tended to under our care.
Life in _temple_ is not a bad one. Perhaps he
will grow up to help poor lost souls like those
of his parents."
<ce>
"This has been a sad tale, and one that we see
repeated so often."
<ce>
"Take care of any young ones you find.
Guide them as you can."
<ce>
"This world is a harsh arena."

Message:  1144
"_temple_ is not wealthy, but we have
gathered a small sum to reumburse you. I hope
also you take away the reward of helping those
less fortunate than yourself."
<ce>
He hands you a small bag of gold.

Message:  1145
"I am so glad to see you have brought the child
back to us. If only his dear lost mother could
still see him."

Message:  1146
"I see your received my letter. You do not have
the child? This troubling. The father you say?
She did not mention him, though she cursed
someone in her fever."
<ce>
"If you could somehow retrieve the child from
this man and return him to us, he would be well
taken care of."

Message:  1147
"You are the one who took the child,
_child_."
<ce>
"I see you have him with you. Have you brought
him back to us?"

Message:  1148
"We will see he is taken care of. You have done
the right thing. We will see to it that the
Knights are informed and there is no further
need to look for you."

Beloved Sister,
<ce>
We have purchased a building in __culthome_
to be our base of operations.
Once I have retrieved my child from that wench
I shall take him with me to be raised in
accordance with the rules of our Lord.
<ce>
Once your tasks in __sishouse_ are complete
you should ride with haste to join us so we
may begin in earnest.

Message:  1202
Dear _father_,
<ce>
It has come to the attention of the Regional
Safety Commission, hereby referred to as RSC,
that a property you are the title holder of in
____cultdun_, namely __cultdun_
does not reach the safety standards for the
administrative region.
<ce>
A recent survey performed found that it met only
2 of the 5 criteria for passable status under
____cultdun_ property law.
<ce>
Under ____cultdun_ property law you now have
90 days to bring the property up to legal code
or The RSC of ____cultdun_ will be forced
to issue a condemnation notice that could result
in a fine and the property being declared unfit
for habitation/trade/perfomance*.
(*delete where applicable).
<ce>
Please look into this matter with the utmost
urgency.

Message:  1207
Dear %pcn,
<ce>
I am writing to inform you that poor
_questgiver_ passed away this morning. I did not
think she would hold out that long given how ill
she was but I believe she wanted to see her child
one last time. It was unfortunate that this could
not be so.
<ce>
I'm sure there is a good reason you have not
returned with little _child_ and I hope
he is safe in your care.
<ce>
However if you can bring him back to us at the
temple we will see to it that he is given a home
and a loving family.
<ce>
He has been through enough at such a young age.
<ce>

%pcn
It has been reported to us that you have taken
a child that does not belong to you. You are to
return this child immediately to _temple_
to be cared for. We will not broker any excuses.
He was tended into your care by his late mother
and as such it is your responsibily to return
him.
<ce>
If this letter finds it's way to you, then be
assured we will also.
<ce>
Do the right thing.

Message: 1209
Dear _sister_,
<ce>
This is to confirm that your fresh horse will
await you, as arranged, at _remtav_.
I have also reserved you a room with the Inkeep.
As your request was both urgent and specific this
is reflected in the cost I am afraid. The calibre
of horse alone was expensive, and along with the
room reservation (which I needed to pay extra for
due to the season I might add) as well as my own
fee will bring the total to 1,798 gold.
<ce>I shall await you at the inn. I would have
put this on credit for you, however the nature of
the circumstances will require immediate payment
in gold.
<ce>
It has been good doing business with you and your
"family" and I wish you success in your future
endevours, whatever they may be.

Well, you know what they say. If you can't say anything nice...
<--->
I feel sorry for that child. Father run off. Mother a drunk.
<--->
I've seen _questgiver_ in alleys with strange men.
<--->
Seen her worse for wear a few times. That poor child.

Message:  1204
Horrible woman that.
<--->
Takes in all kinds that one. Soft heart under all that stone.
<--->
Wouldn't want to get into an argument with that one.

Message:  1205
That's a rum character and no mistake.
<--->
Very close with his sister I hear. Very close.
<--->
He and his friends have been buying property in ___culthome_ I hear.
<--->
He's a dark one. Sister in ___sishouse_ is no better.
<--->
I used to be friends with his sister, _sister_, until she... well, lets say you don't want to turn your back on her.

Message:  1206
Very close with her brother I hear. Very close.
<--->
Very shady character. I'd avoid that one if I was you.
<--->
Lives in __sishouse_. Alone, but seems to have all sorts coming and going. All sorts.

-- General Rumours
Message:  1210
My brother saw someone get caught shoplifting earlier with a baby. Some folk are really desperate.

Message:  1211
Poor _questgiver_'s baby got snatched I hear. Who would do such a thing?
<--->
I hear _questgiver_'s baby was taken. A mother like that, it was going to happen.

Message: 1212
_questgiver_ is very sick I hear. Taken to temple. Not looking good.
<--->
I hear that _questgiver_ has died or something, Daedra took her baby.

<ce>                  You've been left holding the baby.

<ce>                       The child starts to cry.

Message:  1313
<ce>              Do you wish to try to soothe the child with
a song?

Message:  1314
<ce>You sing the child an old %ra lullaby.
<ce>Your dulcent tones seem to settle him.

Message:  1315
<ce>You try to sing him an old %ra lullaby,
<ce>but unfortunately your awkward scaling
<ce>seems to upset him even more.

Message:  1307
<ce>            His crying has drawn the attenton of a harpy.

Message:  1308
<ce>            Actually it looks like it's just an old lady.

Message:  1316
The old lady gives you a few coins to buy the kid a treat.

Message:  1317
<ce>The child spots a cat and tries to chase
<ce>after it, luckily you manage to keep a hold
<ce>of the boy so he doesn't scamper off.

Message:  1318
<ce>The child spots a cat and, before you can
<ce>stop him, he struggles out of your arms and
<ce>scampers off after it.
<ce>
<ce>                           The chase is on.

Message:  1342
<ce>               Try to grab the kid before he gets lost?

Message:  1343
<ce>       You manage to scoop him up before he gets into trouble.

Message:  1344
<ce>The kid slips through your fingers
<ce>and chases the cat around a corner.

Message:  1319
<ce>           He's gone into _store_. Best retrive him before
<ce>           his lack of mercantile skill cause problems for
<ce>                                 you.

Message:  1345
<ce>                             You got him.

Message:  1325
<ce>           Oops. Child took a malachite statue off a shelf.
<ce>                Good thing you noticed before leaving.
<ce>                    That could have been awkward.

Message:  1326
<ce>          Also, that statue is not at all appropriate for a
<ce>           child. They should really put those on a higher
<ce>                                shelf.

Message:  1327
<ce>                          A guard appaears.

Message:  1329
<ce>            Oh no. Looks like the kid grabbed a malachite
<ce>                         statue in the store.
<ce>
<ce>            Also, that's not the kind of statue you really
<ce>                      want the kid playing with.
<ce>
<ce>                  Do you hand it over to the guard?

Message:  1304
<ce>                         The child is hungry.
<ce>
<ce>Do you want to try feeding him a ration
<ce>from your backpack?

Message:  1352
<ce>He spat it out and made a face. Seems he doesn't
<ce>like rations.
<ce>
<ce>Maybe you can find something else for him to eat?

Message:  1347
<ce>             The kid is really hungry now and starting to
<ce>                              get upset.

Message:  1332
<ce>           You spot a street trader selling snacks. Mainly
<ce>           some kind of meat on a stick. Not ideal, but you
<ce>             doubt the kid will eat your travel rations.
<ce>
<ce>                               Buy one (5g)?

Message:  1359
<ce>Do you want to order him something from the kitchens (19g)?

Message:  1333
<ce>           The kid wants a red one. Those look quite spicy,
<ce>             get him one of those instead of the regular?

Message:  1334
<ce>                    The kid seemed to enjoy that.

Message:  1360
<ce>Todays special is Fish & bread platter. He ate
that ok, quite a large meal for a small child so
you finished it off.


Message:  1337
<ce>                  The kid starts to throw a tantrum.

Message:  1338
<ce>                          Now he's crying again.

Message:  1339
<ce>                             Will you try singing?

Message:  1340
<ce>            Well that didn't work and the crying has drawn
<ce>                 the attention of another old crone.

Message:  1348
<ce>          The crying has drawn the attention of another old
<ce>                                crone.

Message:  1350
<ce>              Oh, no... it's actually a harpy this time.

Message:  1341
<ce>            While you were dealing with the harpy the kid
<ce>            dozed off. He's also apparently eaten some of
<ce>                    your rations anyway. Oh well.

Message:  1346
<ce>          He's taken the regular snack and thrown it on the
<ce>                               ground.
<ce>
<ce>                     He's throwing a tantrum.

Message:  1356
<ce>It seems you can't afford that right now.

Message:  1305
<ce>                        The child has pooped.

Message:  1310
<ce>            Do you want to attempt to fashion a makeshift
<ce>                  diaper from random cloth and junk?

Message:  1311
<ce>                      Not perfect, but it'll do.

Message:  1312
<ce>            Well that didn't work and now you are covered
in poop as well.

Message:  1309
<ce>                       The poop has drawn rats.

Message:  1336
<ce>        The spicy poop has caused the rats to become frenzied.

Message:  1306
<ce>                    An elderly lady appoaches you.

Message:  1320
<ce>                        A man approaches you.

Message:  1358
<ce>You have probably lost him, but you bet he'll
send people after you. Best get the kid home.

Message:  1321
<ce>       In the confusion the man grabs the child and dissapears.

Message:  1357
<ce>While you were distracted someone grabbed the kid and ran off.

Message:  1322
<ce>               This note claims they have a property called
<ce>___cultdun_ in ____cultdun_.
<ce>                         Maybe that is where _father_ has fled to.

Message:  1335
<ce>_questgiver_ might be back by now.
I should go to _house_ and check.

Message:  1353
<ce>_sister_ has run off, maybe in
<ce>her haste to escape she left something behind.
<ce>I should check her home again.

Message:  1355
<ce>This is an invoice for a horse and lodgings at
<ce>__remtav_. Maybe that is where she is heading?

Message:  1361
<ce>_sister_ and _broker_ are dead.
<ce>Maybe one of them might have something on them that will
<ce>point me towards where _father_ has taken the kid?

Message:  1323
<ce>              __culthome_. Is that where he has taken the kid?

Message:  1349
<ce>                Are you sure you want to leave the kid there?

Message:  1324
<ce>             The child is safe, however _father_ is dead.
<ce>            It looks like he was injured but got the child
<ce>                  to relative safety before he died.

Message:  1351
<ce>            A street urchin of the usual sort calls you by
<ce>            name and proffers a letter at you. You take it
<ce>                     from him and he dissapears.

Message:  1354
<ce>              You hope _child_ is ok with his "father".
<ce>                 They have probably moved on by now.
