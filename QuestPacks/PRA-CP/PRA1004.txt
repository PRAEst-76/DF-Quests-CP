QuestorOffer:  [1000]
Dear %pct, you could help me. If you could. You see I have an urgent meeting with a person of note and cannot find someone to take care of my child, _child_. Can you please just look after %g2 for a moment. I should not be more than an hour. Then I will return and take %g2 again and pay you. Please. This is very important. Our future depends on it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
Oh no. What shall we do now. Please. Oh. My child!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
OH! Thanks you! I shall not be long. Merely a few hours. No longer. I will meet you at my home, once my business has concluded. I shall be at _house_ in __house_ In 12 hours. No longer. I promise. I shall return in no less than a day. Please take care of my child!

QuestFail:  [1003]
You failed to keep the child safe.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
Well done. You took care of a child.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_questgiver_ is a terrible mother. Always pawning that poor child off on strangers so she can do her "business"

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Did you hear that poor _child_ was lost?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I feel for poo _child_. Parents like that.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]

A lady called _questgiver_ has got me to babysit her child _child_ while she goes... somewhere. She promises she'll come back to retrieve %g2 soon, but was unspecific as to when. I am to return the child to _house_ in __house_... at some stage.

Halt stranger. That is my child you have there. I demand you turn %g2 over to me. %g3 mother is a drunk and a whore and I'm sick of her leaving %g2 with strangers like you while she plies her wares in back alleys.
Turn him over now and you will depart with your life.

Message:  1101
You have done the right thing stranger. This child will have no life of consequence with that strop. I will take %g2 far from this place and see her life is rich and fullfiling.

Message:  1102
I will not risk my child's life by attacking you, no. I will find some other way to retrieve my child. I will bide my time. Waiting for the right moment for you to be distracted talking to me while my brother attacks from behind.

Message:  1103
_questgiver_? No. She is not here. I know not where she is.
No. I will not take the child. You agreed to do this, any risk is on your hands. I let _questgiver_ doss here, but I don't get involved beyond that.
Be off with you. Return when she does. I will speak with you no longer.

Message: 1104
Oh. You are the person _questgiver_ employed to take care of _child_. It is good you have returned. I fear _questgiver_ is deathly ill. She had an... accident. She is at _temple_. Take her child to her. A _priest_ is taking care of her there.

Message:  1105
You return. Good.
Where... where is my baby?

Message:  1106
You what?!
You fool, %g3 father is dead! You have given my baby to a cult!
Oh no!!! You monster! My baby!
Go! Get my child. If you are good for anything you will undo what you have done before... before they...
Go you idiot! What are you waiting for?!
<ce>
Do you agree to retrive the Child?

Message:  1107
Aaah! No! You've killed my baby! You've killed my baby!!

Message: 1108
I don't know where they are, but you might want to speak to _sister_ in __sishome_. She might know. She is his sister. They used to be close. Too close!
Go! Find her. Make her tell you where they are. Ask people! Do something!!
Get my baby!

Message: 1110
Oh, what a cute little button. Looks just like you!

Message:  1111
Adventuring is a bit of a difficult life for a child isn't it? With all those nasty monsters and Orcs and such coming at you with weapons. Where do you keep the child during your questin'? In a bag or do you have someone that holds 'em while you get to slayin'?

Message:  1112
Is the little one on solids now? Eating carrots? Carrots are good for the hair I belive. Might make it red though. No-one wants a red haired child.

Message:  1113
Ours went to school in Wayrest of course. Just the best for ours. She turned out well. Works for the bank there now. Doesn't have red hair. You might want to consider that kind of life for your child.

Message:  1114
I mean, it's not for me to judge. That's your child. Just saying that I think your line of work isn't a great life for a child. Very dangerous.

Message:  1115
Look at me rabbiting on like this. I really must be off. Those messages won't run themselves. And I've got to meet %fn to let her in on the latest gossip.

Message: 1116
Oh, speaking of which. Did you hear the latest about %fn? She's got herself a new man. Didn't wait long for that. I guess they don't wait these days.

Message:  1117
I see that _father_ was seen doing some business at The Bank of ___culthome_. Suspicious one that. The sister is no better. If she even is his sister. Something weird going on there.

Message:  1118
Anyways. Must be off. Take care of that little one when you are doing yer murderous speluking won't you?

Message: 1119
And don't let her eat any carrots. You know what that causes!

Message: 1120
How awfully rude. I guess parents these days just aren't up to much. Hhmph.

Message:  1121
Who are you?
Oh, you are the %ra _questgiver_ left _child_ with. Well you are too late. She's... had an accident. She's at _temple_ in __temple_. I don't think she'll make it this time. I always warned her...
<ce>
Anyway, you should take the child there. Maybe, it might help her to see her little one.

Message:  1125
Yes, I am _sister_. What do you want?

Message:  1126
_father_? Who sent you? No matter, I'll send you back to them in peices.
