QuestorOffer:  [1000]
Dear %pct, you could help me. If you could?
You see I have an urgent meeting with a person
of note and cannot find someone to take care of
my child, _child_.
Can you please just look after %g2 for a moment.
I should not be more than an hour. Then I will
return and take %g2 again and pay you.
Please.
This is very important. Our future depends on it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
Oh no. What shall we do now. Please. Oh. My child!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
OH! Thanks you! I shall not be long.
Merely a few hours. No longer.
I will meet you at my home, once my business has
concluded.
I shall be at _house_ in
__house_ In 12 hours.
No longer. I promise.
I shall return in no less than a day.
Please take care of my child!

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>You failed to keep the child safe.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>Well done. You took care of a child.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_questgiver_ is a terrible mother. Always pawning that poor child off on strangers so she can do her "business"

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Did you hear that poor _child_ was lost?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I feel for poor _child_. Parents like that...

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Thank you.

%qdt
A lady called _questgiver_ has got me to babysit
her child while she goes... somewhere. She
promises she'll come back to retrieve %g2 soon,
but was unspecific as to when.
I am to return the child to _house_
in __house_... at some point.

Message: 1031
%qdt
A man called _father_ who claims to be the child's
father stopped me and demanded the child.
He claimed the child's mother was an unfit parent
and demanded I turn the child over to him.

Message: 1032
The man seemed sincere, also desperate and
somewhat threatening.
I hope I did the right thing.

Message: 1033
The man seemed desperate and threatening. So I
refused his request. One of his associates
attempted to ambush me.

Message: 1034
He snatched the child in the struggle, and
vanished. I don'k know where he went. I guess I
need to go speak to _questgiver_ at
_house_. Maybe she knows who he is.
This won't be easy.

Message: 1035
%qdt
_questgiver wasn't there yet. Seems to be taking
a long time. Her housemate was unhelpful.
I will need to return later.

Message: 1036
%qdt
_questgiver_ was understandably very upset. She
claimed the man was not the child's father.
However she seemed to know who he was and told
me to speak to a woman called _sister_
who is possibly the man's sisters who lives
in __sisterhome_.

Message: 1037
%qdt
_sister_ was... unhelpful.
There might be something in her home that will
point me in the direction of _father_. Otherwise
it's back to asking the locals.

Message: 1038
%qdt
Apparently _father_ is in a house called
_culthome_ in __culthome_. He's probably not
going to just hand over the child willingly.
I'll need to think about how to handle this.

Message: 1039
%qdt
They asked me to leave _culthome_.
Said the child will have a better life there.
Place stank of evil.

Message: 1040
%qdt
I've got the child. Now to get him back to his
mother.

Message: 1041
%qdt
_father_ has taken off with the kid after setting
his men on me.
I'll need to look around for clues as to where he
may have gone.

Message: 1042
%qdt
It seems _father_ has another shady property
called _cultdun_ in ___cultdun_.
I guess I should look there.

Message: 1043
%qdt
It appears _father_ was injured in the
struggle before he fled.
I'm going to try to follow his blood trail.

Message: 1044
%qdt
_father_ is dead. I didn't badly injure
him, so I can only assume he met his end from
the squatters in _cultdun_.
The child is ok. It looks like he was trying
to protect the kid. Maybe he really was his
father.
Now to take the kid and get out of here.

Message: 1045
In a tragic twist it seems _questgiver_
has succumbed to what her unsympathetic
landlady termed "an accident". She implied this
wasn't the first, but is possibly the last.
I should see the priest, _priest_ at
_temple_ in __temple_ who is taking care of her.

Message:  1100
Halt stranger. That is my child you have there.
I demand you turn %g2 over to me. %g3 mother is a
drunk and a whore and I'm sick of her leaving %g2
with strangers like you while she plies her wares
in back alleys.
<ce>
Turn him over now and you will depart with your life.

Message:  1101
You have done the right thing stranger.
<ce>
This child will have no life of consequence with
that strop. I will take %g2 far from this place
and see %g2 life is rich and fullfiling.

Message:  1102
I will not risk my child's life by attacking you.
No.
I will find some other way to retrieve my child.
I will bide my time. Waiting for the right moment
for you to be distracted talking to me while my
brother attacks from behind.

Message:  1103
_questgiver_? No. She is not here.
I know not where she is.
No. I will not take the child. You agreed to do
this, any risk is on your hands.
I let _questgiver_ doss here,
but I don't get involved beyond that.
Be off with you. Return when she does.
I will speak with you no longer.

Message:  1104
Oh. You are the person _questgiver_
employed to take care of _child_.
It is good you have returned.
I fear _questgiver_ is deathly ill.
She had an... accident.
She is at _temple_.
Take her child to her.
_priest_ is taking care of her there.

Message:  1105
You return. Good.
Where... where is my baby?

Message:  1106
You what?!
You fool, %g3 father is dead!
You have given my baby to a cult!
Oh no!!! You monster! My baby!
Go! Get my child!
If you are good for anything you will undo what
you have done before... before they...
Go you idiot! What are you waiting for?!
<ce>Do you agree to retrive the Child?

Message:  1107
Aaah! No! Nononono!
You've killed my baby!
You've killed my baby!!

Message:  1108
I don't know where they are, but you might want
to speak to _sister_ in __sishome_.
She might know. She is his sister.
They used to be close.
Too close!
Go! Find her!
Make her tell you where they are.
Ask people! Do something!!
Get my baby!

Message:  1110
Oh, what a cute little button. Looks just like you!

Message:  1111
Adventuring is a bit of a difficult life for a
child isn't it? With all those nasty monsters
and Orcs and bandits and such coming at you with
weapons.
Where do you keep the child during your questin'?
In a bag or do you have someone that holds 'em
while you get to slayin' and lootin'?

Message:  1112
Is the little one on solids now?
Eating carrots?
Carrots are good for the hair I belive.
Might make it red though.
No-one wants a red haired child.
Perish the thought!

Message:  1113
Ours went to school in Wayrest of course.
Just the best for ours. She turned out well.
Works for the bank there now. Doesn't have red
hair.
You might want to consider that kind of life for
your child.

Message:  1114
I mean, it's not for me to judge. That's your
child. Just saying that I think your line of work
isn't a great life for a child.
Very dangerous.

Message:  1115
Look at me rabbiting on like this.
I really must be off.
Those messages won't run themselves.
And I've got to meet %fn to let her
in on the latest gossip.

Message:  1116
Oh, speaking of which; did you hear the latest
about %fn?
She's got herself a new man!
Didn't wait long for that.
I guess they don't wait these days.

Message:  1117
I see that _father_ was seen doing
some business at The Bank of
___culthome_.
Suspicious one that.
The sister is no better.
If she even is his sister.
Something weird going on there.

Message:  1118
Anyways. Must be off.
Take care of that little one when you are doing
yer murderous speluking won't you?

Message:  1119
And don't let her eat any carrots.
You know what that causes!

Message:  1120
How awfully rude. I guess parents these days just
aren't up to much. Hhmph.

Message:  1122
Thank you for taking care of my baby. I hope you
didn't have too much trouble.

Message:  1123
Here is some payment for your time. I shall
reccomend you to all my friends.

Message:  1125
Yes, I am _sister_. What do you want?

Message:  1126
_father_? Who sent you? No matter, I'll send you
back to them in peices.

Message:  1135
I know why you are here. She sent you! She is a
drunken sot, not fit to be a mother, but no
matter.
You may leave.
Tell her whatever.
If she shows up here she will be killed as a
trespasser, as will you.
The child stays with me.

Message:  1136
You were warned. Men!

Message:  1137
You won't take the child!

Message:  1141
I'm glad you arrived. _questgiver_ is gravely ill.
Her life choices have taken their toll I fear.
Perhaps seeing this little one safe will help
ease her pain.

Message:  1143
_child_ will be tended to under our care.
Life in _temple_ is not a bad one. Perhaps %g
will grow up to help poor lost souls like those
of %g3 parents.
<ce>
This has been a sad tale, and one that we see
repeated so often.
Take care of any young ones you find.
Guide them as you can. This world is a harsh arena.

Message:  1144
The _temple_ is not wealthy,
but we have gathered a small sum to reumburse
you.
I hope also you take away the reward of helping
those less fortunate than yourself.

Message:  1201
Beloved Sister,
<ce>
We have purchased a building in __culthome_
to be our base of operations.
Once I have retrieved my child from that wench
I shall take him with me to be raised accordingly
to our masters wishes.
<ce>
Once your tasks are complete you should ride to
join us so we may begin our ascendence.

Message:  1202
Dear _father_,
<ce>
It has come to the attention of the regional
safety commission that a property of yours in
___cultdun_, namely _cultdun_
does not reach the safety standards for the
area.
A recent survey performed found that it met only
2 of the 5 criteria for passable status.
<ce>
Under ___cultdun_ law you now have 90 days
to bring the property up to legal code or The
RSC of ___cultdun_ will be forced to
issue a condemnation notice that could result
in a fine and the property being declared unfit
for habitation/trade/perfomance*.
(*delete where applicable).
