Message:  1035
Excuse me %hnr. Can I help you?

Message:  1036
Ah yes, you are here from the farm. Terrible
business. Just terrible.
<ce>
Please. His Lordship is inside. You may go
through.
<ce>
He is grieving, as you understand, so please be
mindful.

Message:  1037
So the maid sent you?
<ce>
She is a good sort, that one.
<ce>
My son-in-law is in a bad place, we all are, but
his loss has felled him.
<ce>
He knows not why his beloved would leave him so.
She was a troubled girl, in her youth, but happy
she was, with him. We had hoped for
grandchildren.
<ce>
Alas, we shall never see them now.

Message:  1038
They talked of my solution?
<ce>
Surely they expect money. But the farm as it is
would be just a bottomless pit for me to toss my
wealth into. I may as cast it to Oblivion.
<ce>
No. I have a better solution. One that helps us
all. My son, the farm, my... wife.
<ce>
And my beautiful daughter.

Message:  1039
I am a mage of considerable power and means,
%pcf.
<ce>
There are magics the Mages Guild dare not speak
of. For they are fearful of the power. This is a
truth.
<ce>
I can bring my daughter back to this world %pcf.
Back to us and the farm. I have that power.

Message:  1040
Her mother will hear none of this and my son will
hear nothing at all in his current state.
<ce>
I will need you to go to the crypt where my
daugher is interred and bring me back her remains.
<ce>
This... is dirty work, but it is for my family.
I am confident I can do this and you know I can
reward you beyond the reward of seeing a family
together again.

Message:  1041
Can you do this for me? For us?

Message: 1042
Good! So go now to ___grave_ and bring my little
girl back to me. Time is of the essence, so do
not tarry in your task.

Message: 1043
Alas. I expected as much. My servant will show
you out. I can find another, better, to the task.
