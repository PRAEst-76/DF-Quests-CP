"Here is some small payment for what you have done
so far. Now let us meet outside for our onward
journey. We have much work to do."

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I heard weird sounds coming from _dadhouse_ sometimes. Some evil goes on there I'd wager.
<--->
This isn't a bad place to live, though it would be better if it wasn't for that creepy wizard at _dadhouse_.
<--->
Don't drink the water. The nobles puts stuff in it to control our minds.
<--->
Met a Khajiit once. Said some weird stuff. Then licked his own knees.
<--->
Avoid _father_. That wizard is just a crazy old man.
<--->
Stay away from _dadhouse_. I hear noises. Bad noises.

Message: 1011
I heard he was kicked out of the Mages Guild for bad practice.
<--->
Noisy skeltons in that closet. That's all I'm saying.

Message:  1015
That's _father_'s place. You don't want to go there.
<--->
_father_ lives there with his collection of regrets.

Message:  1012
<ce>You need to hurry to ___grave_.
<ce>_father_ does not strike you as a patient man

Message: 1013
You are at the gravesite, now to find where
the girl is buried.

Message: 1014
<ce>You've collected her remains in a sack.
<ce>Now to get them back to _father_.

Message:  1045
Some guards suddenly appear from behind a wall,
"Halt! Graverobber! You dare desecrate this young
woman?! You will lie in a paupers grave of your
own for this!"

Message:  1035
You are stopped at the door by a grim looking butler,
"Excuse me %hnr. Can I help you?"

Message:  1036
You inform him of your business.
<ce>
"Ah yes, you are here from the farm. Terrible
situation. Just terrible!"
<ce>
He waves you through, "Please. His Lordship is inside.
You may go and speak to him."
<ce>
"He is grieving, as you understand, so please be
mindful."

Message:  1037
_father_ is an imposing man, stood before the
fireplace.
<ce>
"So the maid sent you? She is a good sort, that one."
<ce>
He looks into the flames, "My son-in-law is in a bad
place, as are we all... but his loss has felled him."
<ce>
"He knows not why his beloved would leave him so.
She was a troubled girl, in her youth, but happy
she was with him. We had hoped for grandchildren..."
<ce>
He closes his eyes, "Alas, we shall never see them now."

Message:  1038
"They talked of my solution?" he raises an eyebrow.
<ce>
"Surely they expect money. But the farm as it is
would be just a bottomless pit for me to toss my
wealth into. I may as cast it to Oblivion."
<ce>
He finally turns to you, "No. I have a better
solution. One that helps us all. My son, the farm,
my... wife."
<ce>
"And my beautiful daughter."

Message:  1039
He raises himself to his full height,
"I am a mage of considerable power and means,
%pcf."
<ce>
"There are magics the Mages Guild dare not speak
of. For they are fearful of the power. This is a
truth."
<ce>
"I can bring my daughter back to this world %pcf.
Back to us and the farm! I have that power!"

Message:  1040
"Her mother will hear none of this and my son will
hear nothing at all in his current state."
<ce>
"I will need you to go to the crypt where my
daugher is interred and bring me back her remains."
<ce>
"This... is dirty work, but it is for my family.
I am confident I can do this and you know I can
reward you beyond the reward of seeing a family
together again."

Message:  1041
"Can you do this for me? For us?"

Message:  1042
"Good! Good!"
<ce>
"Her grave is at ___grave_. Go and bring
my little girl back to me. Time is of the essence, so
do not tarry in your task. Let none stand in your way."

Message: 1043
"Alas. I expected as much. My servant will show
you out. I can find another, better, to the task."

Message:  1044
<ce>You spot some people near a grave, they seem to have
<ce>have dug up a corpse and are carrying it to a cart.

Message:  1049
"Who in Oblivion are you? We've been tasked with
removing this girls corpse to protect it from
graverobbers. I can only assume that's you. So..."
<ce>They draw their weapons without further conversation.

Message:  1046
"You return. You have the... yes. My daughter."
<ce>
He takes the bundle from you.
<ce>
"How small she seems. Like when... No matter. The
deed is done. This family thanks you, or they
will thank you when our daughter is back with
us once more."

Message:  1047
"There is but one more step. I shall prepare her
remains. If you wish to help me see this through
and return my beautiful daughter to this world
and her beloved then return this time tomorrow."
<ce>
"I shall tell you what needs to be done then.
For now, take this small payment for your deeds
thus far and go and rest at the local inn.
You have earned it, and more my friend."

Message:  1048
"You return once more. Good. I was concerned you
would have been reluctant to help any further.
I'll admit this is a diffcult task, for you and
for us. But a necessary one."

%qdt:
_father_ of ___dadhouse_ wants to
bring his daughter back from the dead. He seems
to think he can do it. He wants me to collect her
remains from her grave at __grave_
and bring them back to him.

Message:  1105
%qdt:
Some people had dug up the girl's grave and were taking
her remains for some reason. I have retrieved them.
Now to get them back to her father at ___dadhouse_.

Message: 1107
%qdt:
The father wanted me to dig up his daughter for
some necromantic ritual. I told him I wished no
part in it. I guess that's that.

Message:  1106
%qdt:
I've returned the remains to the father. What he
plans to do with them is unclear. He told me to
return at the same time tomorrow. I guess I shall
find out then.

Message: 1151
A page stops you and hands you a letter with a
noble seal. He does not make eye contact or await
a gratuity.

Message: 1155
%pcf! You took my daughters remains from
her tomb but did not return them to me.
I will take them from your corpse!

Message: 1156
You hear something. Someone.

Message: 1157
%pcf?
<ce>
I'm afraid you have something that doesn't belong
to you. And knowledge is the most valuable thing
there is.
<ce>
Nothing personal.

Message: 1158
Looks like _father_ didn't want you walking
away knowing what he was planning. You may have
made a powerful enemy.

Message: 1203
%pcf
                                %qdat
I am somewhat dissapointed, but not surprised
that you did not return to me at ___dadhouse_
as I requested. Our task was a heavy one and
I suspected you did not have the gumption for
such work.
<ce>
No matter. I have procured the services of a
mercenary to do that which you could not.
You are no longer required. I expect the
monies paid to you thus far should cover your
expenses while assisting our family.
I bear you no ill will in this, however I do not
expect to see or hear from you again.
<ce>
