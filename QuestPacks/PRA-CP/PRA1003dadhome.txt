You are stopped at the door by a grim looking butler,
"Excuse me %hnr. Can I help you?"

Message:  1036
You inform him of your business.
<ce>
"Ah yes, you are here from the farm. Terrible
situation. Just terrible!"
<ce>
He waves you through, "Please. His Lordship is inside.
You may go and speak to him."
<ce>
"He is grieving, as you understand, so please be
mindful."

Message:  1037
The father is an imposing man, stood before the fireplace.
<ce>
"So the maid sent you? She is a good sort, that one."
<ce>
He looks into the flames, "My son-in-law is in a bad
place, as are we all... but his loss has felled him."
<ce>
"He knows not why his beloved would leave him so.
She was a troubled girl, in her youth, but happy
she was with him. We had hoped for grandchildren..."
<ce>
He closes his eyes, "Alas, we shall never see them now."

Message:  1038
"They talked of my solution?" he raises an eyebrow.
<ce>
"Surely they expect money. But the farm as it is
would be just a bottomless pit for me to toss my
wealth into. I may as cast it to Oblivion."
<ce>
He finally turns to you, "No. I have a better
solution. One that helps us all. My son, the farm,
my... wife."
<ce>
"And my beautiful daughter."

Message:  1039
He raises himself to his full height,
"I am a mage of considerable power and means,
%pcf."
<ce>
"There are magics the Mages Guild dare not speak
of. For they are fearful of the power. This is a
truth."
<ce>
"I can bring my daughter back to this world %pcf.
Back to us and the farm! I have that power!"

Message:  1040
"Her mother will hear none of this and my son will
hear nothing at all in his current state."
<ce>
"I will need you to go to the crypt where my
daugher is interred and bring me back her remains."
<ce>
"This... is dirty work, but it is for my family.
I am confident I can do this and you know I can
reward you beyond the reward of seeing a family
together again."

Message:  1041
"Can you do this for me? For us?"

Message:  1042
"Good! Good!"
<ce>
He shows you a map, "Her grave is here. Go and bring
my little girl back to me. Time is of the essence, so
do not tarry in your task. Let none stand in your way."

Message: 1043
"Alas. I expected as much. My servant will show
you out. I can find another, better, to the task."
