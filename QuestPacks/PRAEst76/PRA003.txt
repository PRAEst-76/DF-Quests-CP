QuestorOffer:  [1000]
I don't need anything doing but I know a lady in
a sad situation that is looking for someone to
help her with a family affair if you are
interested in that sort of thing? Probably won't
involve fighting orcs or slaying dragons, but I
think she is a moneyed dame, if that's your draw? 

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
No skin off my nose. Some people just aren't into
helping those in need, I figure.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Well, you'll find her at _ladyhome_.
Hopefully you can do something for the poor lass.
She should be there for another week or so.

QuestFail:  [1003]
I think _lady_ will have left _ladyhome_ by now.
Oh well.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
They are both at rest now together. Their troubles are over.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I hear _lady_'s got some family troubles.
<--->
Heard about the tragedy at __farm_? That poor girl.
<--->
Heard about the tragedy at __farm_? That poor man.
<--->
Just awful what happened to _widower_'s wife? I blame the parents.
<--->
Did you hear _lady_'s daughter killed herself. Probably money. It's always money.

Message:  1020
Oh hello! Sorry, you startled me. I was lost in
my thoughts.
You have come to help? I'm not sure what you can
do. I'm not sure what anyone can do now. We've
lost our only child. Our beautiful _daughter_.

Message:  1021
You see, she was wed to a man, _widower_. Not of
good stock, but a good man. Built that farm with
his own hands. Tried to give her a good life, but
a few weeks past she took her own life. We do not
know why. She was happy and loved.

Message:  1022
Now he lies there in his rooms, unwilling to eat
or speak to anyone. The farm is going to seed
without his care; the hands are leaving, unable
or unwilling to see him waste away from his
heartbreak.
The maid came to me in tears, not knowing what to
do. He will not speak to me or the girls father.

Message:  1023
I am desperate dear %pct! Can you go to there
and see if you can speak to him and rouse him
from his grief? 

Message:  1024
Thank you %pcf. That is all I ask. Perhaps such
as you can make him see some glimmer of light!
Please now, go to the __farm_ and try to
stir him out of his darkness. Here is some gold
to cover your expenses.

Message:  1025
I'm sorry %hnr. _widower_ is not seeing guests at
this time. He is unwell.

Message:  1026
Oh, _lady_ sent you? In that case he is inside.
Please try to talk him out of his doom. He was a
good man and did not deserve any of this. This
farm is dying without him.

Message:  1027
Who are you? It matters not. Who sent you?
_lady_? _father_?
It matters not. My _daughter_ is gone. All is gone.
Please leave me. I wish to be alone.

Message:  1028
Please, my %hnr. I must speak to you.

Message: 1029
If you look around you will see this farm is
dying as our master dies. As his lady died. It
grieves you see. The workers are leaving. Many
have not been paid this month. The land he worked
so hard for is turning to dust and all the money
has gone.

Message:  1030
However _daughter_'s father, _father_
sent word that he also greatly grieves the loss
of his daugher, however he says he can help us.
Anything that can help _farm_ is worth a try now.

Message:  1031
Go. Speak to him at __dadhome_. See if he can
help us. I know he is a man of considerable wealth and
power.
Please do this. Help end this curse of despair on
this land.

Message:  1032
Then please go. Leave me to my grief.

Message:  1033
The poor man wouldn't speak to me, maybe someone
else here will?

Message:  1035
Excuse me %hnr. Can I help you?

Message:  1036
Ah yes, you are here from __farm_. Terrible
business. Just terrible.
<ce>
Please. His Lordship is inside. You may go through.
He is grieving as you understand so please be
mindful.

Message:  1037
So _widower_'s maid sent you. She is a good
girl. My son-in-law is in a bad place. We all
are, but his loss has felled him. He knows not
why his beloved would leave him so. She was a
troubled girl in her youth, but happy
she was, with him. We had hoped for
grandchildren. Alas, we shall never see them now.

Message:  1038
They talked of my solution? Surely they expected
money. But the farm as it is would be just a
bottomless pit to toss my wealth into. I may as
well cast it into to Oblivion.
<ce>
No. I have a better solution. One that helps us
all. My son, the farm, my... wife.
<ce>
And my beautiful daughter.

Message:  1039
I am a mage of considerable power and means, %pcf.
There are magics the Mages Guild dare not speak
of. For they are fearful of magic. Truthfully.
<ce>
I can bring my daughter back to this world %pcf.
Back to us and the farm

Message:  1040
Her mother will hear none of this and my son will
hear nothing in his current state.
<ce>
I will need you to go to the crypt where my
daugher is interred and bring me back her remains.
<ce>
This... is dirty work, but it is for my family.
I am confident I can do this and you know I can
reward you beyond the reward of seeing a family
together again.

Message:  1041
So go now to __grave_ and bring my little girl back to me.

Message:  1045
Halt! Graverobber! You dare desecrate this young woman?!
You will lie in a paupers grave of your own for this!

Message:  1046
You return. You have the... yes. My daughter. How
small she seems. Like when...
No matter. The deed is done. This family thanks 
you, or they will thank you when our _daughter_
is back with us once more.

Message:  1047
There is but one more step. I shall prepare her
remains. If you wish to help me see this through
and return my beautiful _daughter_ to this world
and her beloved then return this time tomorrow.
<ce>
I shall tell you what needs to be done then.
For now, take this small payment for your deeds
thus far and go and rest. You have earned it,
and more.

Message:  1048
You return once more. Good. I was concerned you
would have been reluctant to help any further.
I'll admit this is a diffcult task, for you and
for us. But a necessary one.

Message:  1049
I have performed the first part of the ritual.
Her heart was the most important aspect of her. I
have removed and prepared it for rebirth into her
new form. The ritus needs to be performed
within a week at _lab_. We should take the
heart and the necessary equipment and make for
_lab_ without delay.

Message:  1050
This is the place. There is an altar within that
needs to be cleansed and prepared. However to get
there we will probably need to face enemies.
Harden yourself. We are almost there. My daughter
will live once more.

Message:  1051
This is the altar %pcf. I shall prepare the
ritual. Keep guard on your guard, for we are
not safe in this place.

Message:  1052
Stop _father_! Stop what you are doing with our
little _daughter_. This is madness! She is dead.
She cannot return.

Message:  1053
_lady_! You followed us here?! I can return her!
I know how. We can have our daughter back with us.
Back with _widower_. He is lost without her!

Message:  1054
_widower_ is dead! His grief destroyed him. His
farm is lost. We've all lost. Let us not lose our
minds and souls as well.

Message:  1055
No. He let his grief consume him. I am stronger.
I have the power to return her to us. I will not
let you stop me.

Message:  1056
You stupid old goat! I always said your lust for
control would destroy you in the end.
Men! End him and retrive my daughters remains!

Message:  1057
Curse you _lady_! %pcf! To my aid!

Message:  1058
She is dead. _lady_ is dead. I knew it would end
like this, but I can still have my daughter.
<ce>
Guard me while I continue the ritual! I can't
afford any more interruptions. Precision is
vital!

Message:  1059
She is waking... She is with us again! My
beautiful _daughter_.
<ce>
_daughter_? Can you hear me? It is _father_, your father?
<ce>
_daughter_?

Message:  1060
Oh no. _daughter_! This cannot be. The ritual was
correct!
_daughter_
No! Stop! %pcf! She is an abomination!
End this, please!

Message:  1061
Noooooo..!

Message:  1062
Then you will also fall! Men, kill the %pct!

Message:  1063
Curse you %pcf. I knew you would not have the
stomach for this. Like many of your kind before
you, you will lie with my witch of
a wife, but in a burial pit.

Message:  1064
Well done all. I shall return my daughter to her
slumber in the family tomb. _father_ can lie here
in the tomb of his own making.
<ce>
There is but one more task to do here. Men, you
know your orders...

Message:  1065
They... they are dead. Both... both of my parents
are dead. I am... finally free. The only... way I
could... escape... thank you &pcf.

Message:  1066
Please... one more... task. Just one more...
Return me to my love. He lies... in _othergrave_
I wish... us to be alone together... as we could
not be... in life.
<ce>
Return me to _widower_. In... _othergrave_.
Please %pcf!

Message: 1067
I have left _daughter_'s remains with those of
_widower_. I hope they find peace here.

Message:  1100
%qdt:
I've been sent by _questgiver_ at __questgiver_
to visit _lady_ at _ladyhome_ in __ladyhome_
who has family issues.

Message:  1101
%qdt:
_lady_ has told me the sad story of her daughter
and sent me to _farm_ in __farm_ to try to talk some sense
to her son-in-law _widower_ who has fallen into
grief.

Message:  1102
%qdt:
The poor man wouldn't speak to me, maybe someone
else here will?

Message:  1103
The maid, _maid_ told me to see _widower_'s father-in-law,
_father_ in __dadhome_ who may be able to help.

Message:  1104
%qdt:
Rather horribly the father wants to try to bring
his daughter back from the dead. He seems to think
he can.
He wants me to collect her remains from _grave_ in __grave_
and bring them back to him.

Message:  1105
%qdt:
I retrived the girls remains, but they were guarded
for some reason. Now to get them back to her father.

Message:  1106
%qdt:
I've returned the remains to the father. What he
plans to do with them is unclear. He told me to
return at the same time tomorrow. I guess I shall
find out then.

Message: 1151
A page stops you and hands you a letter with a
noble seal. He does not make eye contact or await
a gratuity.

Message: 1152
I have collected the remains of _daughter_.
Now to return them to _father_

Message: 1153
Why do we delay?! Time is of the essence in our
task, %pcf!
I must have my daugher back with us.
We must go to the _lab_!
Now!

Message: 1154
Enough! I can no longer tolerate your cowardly
procrastinations, %pcf. If do not posess the
stomach for this then you shall die for wasting
my time and risking my daughter!

Message: 1155
%pcf! You took my daughters remains from
her tomb but did not return them to me.
I will take them from your corpse!

Message: 1201
Dear %pcf
                                %qdat
I have just received word that _widower_ has died.
His heart could no longer take his grief it seems.
The maid said you had not been there. Why did you
not visit him as I asked?!
Maybe there was nothing you could do, but you 
said you would try.
We are now filled with double the sorrow, and his
lands they worked so hard to tame have gone to
seed.
Please do not respond, as I don't really have the
stomach for your excuses.

Message: 1202
Dear %pcf
                                %qdat
I am _maid_, the maid at __farm_. I am writing
with the sad news that our dear lost employer
_widower_ succumed to his grief. I can only
assume that your trip to see his father-in-law
was unsuccessful.
The few of us that are left are packing our
things to leave as the Bank of %reg
has reclaimed the lands and asked us to depart
immediately. I shall be traveling back to my
village, however some here have no place to go.
I hope they will be ok. I'm sure you tried your
hardest to convince _father_ to help.
So I do not blame you in this.
I wish you good health in your travels.
                        Yours faithfully,
                        _maid_

I am somewhat dissapointed, but not surprised
that you did not return to me at __dadhome_
as I requested. Our task was a heavy one and
I suspected you did not have the gumption for
such work.
No matter. I have procured the services of a
mercenary to do that which you could not.
You are no longer required. I expect the
monies paid to you thus far should cover your
expenses while assisting our family.
I bear you no ill will in this, however I do not
expect to see or hear from you again.
