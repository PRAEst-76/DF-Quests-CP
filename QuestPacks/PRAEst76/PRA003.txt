QuestorOffer:  [1000]
I don't need anything doing but I know a lady in
a sad situation that is looking for someone to
help her with a family affair if you are
interested in that sort of thing?

RefuseQuest:   [1001]
No skin off my nose. Some people just aren't into
helping those in need I figure.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
You'll find her at _ladyhome_. Hopefully you
can do something for the poor lass. She should be
there for another week or so.

QuestFail:  [1003]
I think _lady_ will have left _ladyhome_ by now.
Oh well.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
They are both at rest now.
You've done a very good deed.

Message: 1022
_maid_ says: He's not right. Best see his father-in-law, _father_ at _dadhome_.

Message: 1023
