QuestorOffer:  [1000]
I don't need anything doing but I know a lady in
a sad situation that is looking for someone to
help her with a family affair if you are
interested in that sort of thing? Probably won't
involve fighting orcs or slaying dragons, but I
think she is a moneyed dame, if that's your draw? 

RefuseQuest:   [1001]
No skin off my nose. Some people just aren't into
helping those in need, I figure.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Well, you'll find her at _ladyhome_.
Hopefully you can do something for the poor lass.
She should be there for another week or so.

QuestFail:  [1003]
I think _lady_ will have left _ladyhome_ by now.
Oh well.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
They are both at rest now.
You've done a very good deed.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I hear _lady_'s got some family troubles.
<--->
Heard about the tragedy at _farm_? That poor girl.
<--->
Heard about the tragedy at _farm_? That poor man.
<--->
Just awful what happened to _widower_'s wife? I blame the parents.
<--->
Did you hear _lady_'s daughter killed herself. Probably money. It's always money.

Message:  1020
Oh hello! Sorry, you startled me. I was lost in
my thoughts.
You have come to help? I'm not sure what you can
do. I'm not sure what anyone can do now. We've
lost our only child. Our beautiful _daughter_.

Message: 1021
You see, she was wed to a man, _widower_. Not of
good stock, but a good man. Built that farm with
his own hands. Tried to give her a good life, but
a few weeks past she took her own life. We do not
know why. She was happy and loved.

Message: 1022
Now he lies there in his rooms, unwilling to eat
or speak to anyone. The _farm_ is going to seed
without his care; the hands are leaving, unable
or unwilling to see him waste away from his
heartbreak.
The maid came to me in tears, not knowing what to
do. He will not speak to me or the girls father.

Message: 1023
I am desperate dear %pct! Can you go to _farm_
and see if you can speak to him and rouse him
from his grief? 

Message: 1024
Thank you %pcf. That is all I ask. Perhaps such
as you can make him see some glimmer of light!

Message: 1025
I'm sorry %hnr. _widower_ is not seeing guests at
this time. He is unwell.

Message: 1026
Oh, _lady_ sent you? In that case he is inside.
Please try to talk him out of his doom. He was a
good man and did not deserve any of this. This
farm is dying without him.

Message: 1027
Who are you? It matters not. Who sent you?
_lady_? _father_?
It matters not. My _daughter_ is gone. All is gone.
Please leave me. I wish to be alone.

Message: 1028
Please, my %hnr. I must speak to you.

Message: 1029
If you look around you will see this farm is
dying as our master dies. As his lady died. It
grieves. The workers are leaving. Many have not
been paid this month. The land he worked so hard
for is turning to dust and the money is gone.

Message: 1030
_daughter_'s father, _father_ sent word that also
grieves the loss of his daugher, however he has a
solution that may help us. Anything that can help
_farm_ is worth a try now.

Message: 1031
Go. Speak to him at _dadhome_. See if he can help
us. I know he is a man of considerable wealth and
power.
Please do this. Help end this curse of despair on
this land.

Message: 1032
Then please go. Leave me to my grief.

Message: 1035
Excuse me %hnr. Can I help you?

Message: 1036
Ah yes, you are here from _farm_. Terrible
business. Just terrible.
<ce>
Please. His Lordship is inside. You may go through.
He is grieving as you understand so please be
mindful.

Message: 1037
So _maid_ sent you. My son-in-law is in a bad
place. We all are, but his loss has felled him.
He knows not why his beloved would leave him so.
She was a troubled girl in her youth, but happy
she was with him. We hoped for granchildren.
Alas, we shall never see them now.

Message: 1038
They talked of my solution. Surely they expected
money. The farm as it is would be a bottomless
pit to toss my wealth into. I may cast it to
Oblivion.
<ce>
No. I have a better solution. One that helps us
all. My son, the farm, my... wife.
<ce>
And my beautiful daughter.

Message: 1039
I am a mage of considerable power and means, %pcf.
There are magics the Mages Guild dare not speak
of. For they are fearful of magic. Truthfully.
<ce>
I can bring my daughter back to this world %pcf.
Back to us and the farm

Message: 1040
Her mother will hear none of this and my son will
hear nothing in his current state.
<ce>
I will need you to go to the crypt where my
daugher is interred and bring me back her remains.
<ce>
This... is dirty work, but it is for my family.
I am confident I can do this and you know I can
reward you beyond the reward of seeing a family
together again.

Message: 1041
So go now to _grave_ and bring my little girl back to me.

Message: 1045
Halt! Graverobber! You dare desecrate this young woman?!
You will lie in a paupers grave of your own for this!

Message: 1046
You return. You have the... yes. My daughter. How
small she seems. Like when...
No matter. Your part is done. You have done well.
This family thanks you, or will thank you.

Message:  1100
%qdt:
I've been sent by _questgiver_ at __questgiver_
to visit _lady_ at _ladyhome_ in __ladyhome_
who has family issues.

Message: 1101
%qdt:
_lady_ has told me the sad story of her daughter
and sent me to _farm_ to try to talk some sense
to her son-in-law _widower_ who has fallen into
grief.

Message: 1102
%qdt:
The poor man wouldn't speak to me, maybe someone
else here will?

Message: 1103
The maid, _maid_ told me to see _widower_'s father-in-law,
_father_ at _dadhome_ who may be able to help.

Message: 1104
%qdt:
Rather horribly the father wants to try to bring
his daughter back from the dead. He seems to think
he can.
He wants me to collect her remains from _grave_
and bring them back to him.

Message: 1105
%qdt:
I retrived the girls remains, but they were guarded for some reason. 

Message: 1106
%qdt:
I've returned the remains to the father. What he plans to do with them is unclear. I'd rather not know to be fair.
