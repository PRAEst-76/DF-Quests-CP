# DF-Quests
Pack of quests of varying degrees of quality for Daggerfall Unity 0.13.5+ (https://www.dfworkshop.net).

## What is this?

These quests will be randomly issued by talking to Commoners (eg. locals in taverns etc) in the gameworld. They will range in difficulty from trivial to virtually impossible. I've tried to focus on commoners as much as possible because they are the little people who interest me and I feel they get overlooked in the epic scheme of things. I want to bring some richness to their world and their lives. I also want to give back to the Daggerfall Unity modding community that has brought me much joy of late.

I'll add quests to this over time. What is here now is hopefully just the start.

**Caveat:** As I am new to scripting quests and somewhat scatterbrained, there may be breaking bugs or bits that don't make sense. Please report any bugs you find as issues with as much information as possible (Daggerfall Unity version, OS, you character level and class, what mods you have enabled etc.)

## To install:

Copy the PRAEst76 directory and all it's contents into your Daggerfall Unity game folder under
